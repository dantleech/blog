Slept well in the hostel but was awake at 7am, and out of bed at eight. I went
downstairs to get a coffee. The reception was open but the host was busy
making bread and wouldn't serve coffee until 8:30. I sat down and started
programming with bleary eyes. Finally I ordered some scrambled egg which came
with the warm freshly made bread.

Today I wanted to sort out my sleeping problem - I noticed a large camping
shop when I came in to the town yesterday evening, so I checked out of the
hostel and left my stuff "under the stairs" and left at 9:30 to find some
camping gear.

I was early and had to wait thirty minutes for the shop to open, and I sat
down for a coffee and a chocolate croissant, and read the instructions for my
new headphones: the batteries last > 6 hours and they charge in 2 hours. After
digesting this information for 30 minutes I paid and left.

The camping shop was rather large and I asked a (young) sales guy my problem.
I had brought both my leaking air mattress and sleeping bag with me to help
illustrate the issues I was having.

I had intended to get a new Thermarest and hopefully leave my current air
mattress at the camping shop, where maybe they could recycle it. The
Thermarest cost €79, but I ended up getting a lighter and more expensive one
for €129. The problem then shifted to the sleeping bag - I had a look at some
liners which can add about 2-4 degrees to the sleeping bag temperature, and
then at a warmer sleeping bag.

The sleeping bag looked very comfortable, but it was bigger than my old air
mattress and current sleeping bag put together. Which would be fine, but it
would mean reconfiguring my setup, maybe getting a big stuff-bag on the rack
to hold the tent and sleeping bag. Finally I decided to get the mattress
and the sleeping bag liner, finally also adding some mosquito replant (Deet)
and hand sanitizer.

_Got lost after crossing this bridge_

I visited a supermarket and picked up some two vegan bean meals, some cheese
slices and some bread then went back to the hostel and picked up my bags, said
goodbye, and collected my bike from the garage.

The next task was to cycle to the port and buy a ferry ticket. I didn't buy a
ticket online, as my German bank card is not a credit card. So I had to go to
the port.

The port was about 14k from Haarlem but I still managed to get lost a few
times on the way. The town was Ijmuiden, and before going to the port I went
to a supermarket and got some whiskey.

It was pretty easy to find the "DFDS" ferry terminal. I cycled up and it
looked abandoned, but on closer inspection there were people manning the
ticket desks. I asked for a ticket - it cost €180 or so, which was cheaper
than it was online. She then explained that I had to fill in an online form
with about 20 questions, finishing with: "_Why do you think you are exempt from
 two week quarantine_", and the ticket lady said "you just say you are coming
 from Holland, a safe country".

_Empty waiting area_

The ticket was with a cabin, and there were no tickets without a cabin. The
prices onboard seem a little bit cheaper than Helsinki - Travemunde last
year (breakfast is €11, dinner €29, coffee is €3.95). Internet is stupid
expensive (e.g. €20 for 24h).

I am cutting this blog post short as I will not have internet later on, but
should arrive in Newcastle at around 9am and the can start cycling north.
