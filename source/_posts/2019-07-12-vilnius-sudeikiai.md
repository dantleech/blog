The campsite is almost empty and again it's a big one sponsered by the EU.
When I arrived at 18:00 it was empty and I thought it was closed, but I took
the phone number anyway and went to the next campsite on my map 3km down the
road, on arriving there I passed what seemed to be a deer enclosure and there
was a huge stag sitting in the middle of it. There were _lots_ of people at
this place, it seemed like a recreation area, and the campsite was full and I
could hear the "thump thump thump" of club music. I didn't like this, and
thought I would ring the other campsite, someone picked up and said they would
be there in one minute. When I arrived there were already 4 cars in the
parking area, just 20 minutes after I had first arrived. The campsite cost €4
and the guy who was managing it told me there was a shop just around the
corned and I picked up some beers.

This morning I woke up in the dormitory after a good nights sleep and went
down to the kitchen where the hostel guy was making croissants, and the old
korean was sitting at the table. He complained jokingly that the hostel guy
was chucking him out on the street "He put me out on the street, and old guy
like me" "I found you a room in another hostel!, we are fully booked" "On the
street!" the Korean said with a grin.

I waited for the croissants and Stefan joined and I packed my stuff and said
thanks to the hostel guy, he was a very sympatic man and obvsiously enjoyed
what he was doing, and I think he also ran a bigger hostel in town.

It was good to meet Stefan, who was now going to fly back to Berlin. He is an
experienced cycle tourer, and his first tour was riding across Africa when he
was 19, and has done a dozen since, both alone and with friends. We had
developed many of the same habits with regards to touring, and it was good to
chat, and I expect I'll see him again in Berlin.

Vilnius is quite a big city and it took some time to weave my way out of it
and make my way north. There was a head wind for the first time, although not
very strong, strong enough to contiually rush past my ears and distrurb my
music.

The weather forcast was also good for today, and although the clounds looked
primed to yield rain in the morning, they didn't and it was the sunniest day
for a week, although by far cooler than the first day.

I planned to follow the minor road to Utena - a place where I had assumed I
could find accomodation. I read that it was increasingly popular with tourists
(and the other sobreing thing that Wikipedia said about the town was that
2,000 jews were rounded up and shot uner the Nazis during World War II).

The major A road, was under construction however, so the minor road had much
more traffic initially than I had expected, but as I passed a few junctions
most traffic left the road, and soon it was quiet.

The road didn't go all the way to Utena, and I had to cut across some country
and forest roads. The country side was very peaceful and rich, and there was
the constant sound of Cicadas in the long grass.

For lunch I thought I would stop in the town of Molėtai, and I went to the
supermarket and picked up some bread and a drink, and then carried on looking
for a bench, but I left the town without finding one. About 5km later I found
a lonely bus stop, and had a picnic there.

Arriving in Utena I headed to what I assumed was a "hotel", but when I arrived
it was a guest house, and cost €35 (I didn't speak to anybody, but checked on
the internet). I had assumed there was a hostel here, and failing that some
hotels, but there was nothing, only more expensive guest houses (2 of them).
Looking at the map I saw a campsite 10km further on and left Utena.

So as mentioned at the beginning, it was empty I checked out the other
campsite didn't like it and came back.

*The road*

Whilst writing this blog post a couple has setup 20m from my tent.

This is likely my last night in Lithuania, depending on if I head north or
north-west, my next checkpoint is the capital of Latvia which is about another
200k from here depending on the route.

My language learning is not going to well, I haven't managed to use anything
I have learnt in the wild, only saying "Achu" occasionally, but then it often
feels better to offer full disclosure and say "Thankyou". Latvia is related to
Lithuanian, but the hostel guy said that they Lithuanians and Latvians could
not understand one another, and the words for "hello", "goodbye" and (I think)
"thankyou" are different, so it will be back to square one.
