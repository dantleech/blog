Slept badly in the campsite last night. It was cold and my air matress seems
to have very small puncture and it deflates impartially, just enough so that
my body to intermittently come into contact with the ground when I'm turning
in my sleep. I woke at 2am, 5am and 6am, before finally waking for good at
around 7am. Again, only bread and peanut butter for breakfast with a nice cup
of coffee.

I used the facilities to wash my cooking equipement. For dinner I had a pack
of reheatable rice with some lentils. I cooked my dry lentils for about 10
minutes, not enough time as they didn't taste particularaly good. I think I
might get some vegetable stock and try lentil soup at some point.

It had rained the night before but it stopped before I left the tent and
didn't start again all day. When I left the campsite the owner looked up but
ignored me and I left, continuing on my way to my first waypoint, Neuminster.
From there I would ride to Rendsburg before making the final push to
Flensburg.

Rendsburg was on the other side of a large shipping canal, the Kiel Canal.
There were no bridges only the gigantic iron Rendsburg High Bridge - high
enough to let gigantic ships pass beneath it. The land is flat on either side
and trains are elevated to the bridges height by a spiral loops. It is the
longest railbridge in Europe.

Realising that there was no possiblity of crossing the railbridge I wondred
how I would cross. The cycle route indicated that I could cross _under_ the
railway bridge, presumably by ferry. When I got to the crossing it was closed
for maintainence, or just closed, I'm not sure. Interestingly it wasn't ferry
but a transporter bridge, where a section of road is suspended from the
railway bridge above and moved back and forth. Before I turned off to the
defunct transporter bridge I thought I heard another cycling shout at me "...
.. nicht mehr" (something, something, no more). I looked back and his gaze
wasn't directed at me so I ignored it.

I stood in front of the railway bridge and said "Well, how the fuck am I
supposed to get across now?" then the other cyclists (an old man and his wife)
caught up with me, he was beaming and said that there is a crossing 1km down
the river, I said "Is there a bridge?" in German, but the old man looked
confused and turned to his wife "Did you understand what he said?", yep, my
German still sucks.

It was a ferry crossing and it was 2km down the canal. It didn't cost anything
and I made my way to the town center and found a bakery.

The bakery didn't have any savoury food left (and I was all out of bread and
backed beans). I got a coffee and an apple cake. I decided to book my hostel
for the night.

I decided to stay in a hostel, as there were no less than 3 in Flensburg,
inclduing a hostelling international one, which was full. The other was not
and I booked (again I used my German, but again the guy didn't have a clue
what I was saying).

There is a cycle route (marked on _my_ map as `OM`) which tracks my route and
takes me all the way to the top of Denmark, it is not direct however, and I
can often find cycle paths on direct roads and avoid it altogether. Sometimes
I find my self on it however, and today it yielded a surprise.

The region I was cycling through was Schleswig-Holstien, and I was in the
eponymous town Schleswig. Following my GPS I found myself driving through the
huge gates of a manor, a gigantic, magestic, white building. The path skirted
around the side and then I found myself riding through the gardens where there
were numerous sculptures and water features and it made me wonder if I should
stick to the cycle route more often, but time and my stamina is limited.

Whilst the last few days had been flat, this part of the route became
undulating. The most hilly it has been since day one.

I arrived in Flensburg (home of the Flensburger beer, a national favourite)
and the closest town to the Danish border (which is just 7km away). I found
the hostel and booked in - it was more expensive that I had thought, but I
piad for breakfast and the room and it cost €28. The girl at reception let me
put the bike in the room ("My boss doesn't like it, but as long as it's
clean). I am currently the only person in the 4 bed room.
