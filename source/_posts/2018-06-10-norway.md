I have been working in Berlin for almost a year, and previous to that I was in
London for 6 months. So that means I have not been travelling for over a year
and a half. Time to do something. To Norway!

My Bicycle is in Weymouth, I am in Berlin. The bicycle needs to come to me, or
I need to go to the bicycle.

I originally planned to get the plane to England, the train to Weymouth, and
then get my bicycle, get the train back to London to retrieve my touring
equipement (which is stashed in the basement of my brothers friend). From here
I would have cycled to Calais and up the coast, into Denmark and over to
Kirstsand, then, because I would already be running out of time, turn east and
cycle down through Sweden.

It turns out my brother is _driving_ to Halle (Westfalen) to see a Tennis
tournament next week, and he would be able to take my bicycle with him. This
means that I save at least 5 days of travelling and can hopefully cycle from
Halle directly north and then cycle up the _west coast_ of Norway.

Very rough plan:

- Bielefeld, DE => Hirtshals, NO ~700k (7 days)
- Kristansands => Trondheim ~850k (15.5 days)
- Trondheim => Oslo ~450k (20 days)
- Oslo => Trelleborg, SV ~500k (25 days)
- Trelleborg, DE => Berlin ~250k (27.5 days)

The time estimates assume 100k per day, but there will almost certainly be
rest days, and 100k is an ambitious target in mountainous areas, so will see
how it goes and may have to take the train.
