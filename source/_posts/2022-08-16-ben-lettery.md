*Rough Route*

I'm now sitting in the lounge of the Ben Lettery Hostel. This is a big hostel,
there are groups and individuals, French, Spanish, German. Mostly French.
There are lots of French about in general. For dinner I cooked
_baked-beans-on toast à la cacouette_ (baked beans on toast with peanut
butter). Peanut butter has previously been trialled in other expeditions and
was found to be highly suitable to put into anything. There is a guitar on the
wall and there are mountains.

Today was a surprisingly easy day, depite the fact that I got the hostel wrong
not once but twice and ended up cycling 140k instead of 100k.

I woke up after a very good nights sleep at the hostel, I was in a different
dormitory from the previous night, but I think the snorer moved on, I would
have heard him through the wall otherwise. In the 10 bed dorm there was only
me and one other person. I had breakfast and noticed something strange: my
legs didn't ache, the rest day had done good. I left without ceremony.

My clothes were clean. I had asked at the bar if they provided a laundry
service for the hostel, the bar maid consulted the French work-away volunteer,
she thought quickly "if you give me your clothes now. I will wash them". They
were ready the next day, it's a good thing as I had finally run out of clean
underwear (which is important to avoid chronic bum pain).

It was another good day for cycling, it was cloudy but it didn't rain. I
doubled back on myself to recross Achill Island, and I joined the [Great
Western Greenway](https://www.greenway.ie/great-western-greenway/).

When I rode into Achill Island I made use of the Greenway but didn't realise
it's extent. I rejoined it on the way out and traversed it completely, it runs
from Achill to Westport. Like many other "greenways" it's based on an old
train line which was built in the late victorian period. It had a great
surface, did not incline or decline steeply, and most importantly the wind was
behind me, today was windy and I was flying.

It advertises itself as one of the top 3 cycle routes in the world, and I
would have no reason to disagree. The scenery was impressive. I passed many
other cyclists going against the wind in the other direction until I almost
grew tired of nodding and smiling. There were bicycle pumps at intervals and
drinking water too.

The greenway passed through Newport to Westport - which is probably the
busiest town I've passed through so far. I didn't stop however and passed
through, leaving the Greenway.

There were two options to reach the hostel I thought I was heading to: to
follow the main roads, or to follow the EV1. I approached the critical
junction and paused. I was not in a hurry, I had made very good time due to
the Greenway and the wind. The road which branched off said "Sheeffry Pass".
It added an additional 20k or so to the journey, and I decided to skip it, and
I rode past, before thinking again and doubling back and turning off, I had no
excuse.

I had expected it to be a tough ride, for it to be the hard part of the day
which could potentially pay off through the scenery, but no. It seemed to be
down hill most of the way, the wind was still behind me, even the pass
presented no problem, it was 200m but I was already at 140m when I started it.

At this point the mountains were in view, and I was in the foothills, the
mountains were majestic, and I took 17 photos and 2 videos (normal days see me
taking around 5).

I passed a fjord and turned off into a valley, past a lake and approached the
hostel. When I had booked the hostel yesterday I had thought it was the hostel
by the fjord, but it wasn't. I approached the hostel's location, looking
forward to stopping, but there were no signs, just a dirt track. Then it
dawned on me: I didn't check the location of the hostel I booked last night.
With an looming sense of fear I checked the location, I was only slightly
relieved when I realised it was about 10k further on, also in the "wrong"
direction.

I arrived at the hostel, there were more French people (from Grenoble) and a
German (from Munich) also waiting to check-in. I made myself a coffee and
waited, once checked in I had a shower and cooked my food and started writing
this blog post.
