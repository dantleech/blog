I don't seem to have succeeded in integrating very well in the hostel I've
been staying in for the past 2 days, having not really broken the ice with
people in general (with some exceptions) and feeling a little depressed and
drained. Most of the staff and guests are relatively young (one girl, 18, is 
still at high school in Italy) so maybe it's the generation gap. I did have a
good chats with a guy from Wales, and another from Helsinki.

My activities have been running, programming and drinking (coffee by day, beer
by night). Being careful not to run to fast (due to recurring injury) I have
managed to do to ~8-10k runs, following the same route, through the beautiful
"victory park" (??) running along the stream, crossing the bridge over the
river ---- then running down to the next one and crossing back and running
through the old
town.

Like Vilnius, Riga has a huge number of churches and God doesn't seem to be
dead here, religious thought is given to the deceased in the countless
well-kept grave yards I have encountered on the route, whilst graveyards are
usually abandoned in the UK, here there it seems there is almost always some
people walking about, maintaining the graves and paying their respects, even
in otherwise remote areas.

Today I visited the "Museum of the Occupation", if you google this museum you
will see a large and impressive building, rectangular with black slate panels.
This building however is undergoing renovation, and the museum has been moved
to a building in a series of embassy-like buildings just outside of the old
town.

Admission to the museum was an optional donation, I donated €5 and walked
upstairs. The "museum" was really just three rooms, each with a numbered
series of panels. Each room presenting a different era of occupation starting
from the end of World War I when both Germany and Russia had to relinquish
their claims on the Baltic states leaving them to declare independence.

This ended when Nazi Germany and the USSR agreed to partition Poland
between them and for the Baltic states to be incorporated into the USSR. They
immediately started deporting natives and importing Russians, deprecating the
currency and persecuting political "enemies".

In 1941 however Germany declared war on Russia and invaded and occupied the
rest of Poland and the Baltic states, and applying their Jewish policies. In
1944 the states were "liberated" by the Red Army, and then the situation
reverted to the original Russian occupation, and this continued for 50 years
until 1991 when Mikhail Gorbachev instigated economic reforms and the Baltic
states decided that now was the time to declare themselves independent, the
Russians attempted to regain control by force, but eventually an agreement was
made and the states become once again independent.

Around 800,000 Russians were bought in to the country during the occupation
(the Germans immigrated 180,000, but all were forcefully expelled at the end
of the war). Apparently in 1981 the percentage of Latvians in Riga was only
36.5%.

I guess I will move again tomorrow - I will go north east, to the national
park and the town of Cēsis where there is a castle and some hotels, from there
heading into Estonia, aiming maybe for the town of Tartu before going to
Tallinn.

I researched options for returning to Germany today -- the boat from Helsinki
will cost around €250, not including the €50 ferry from Tallinn to Helsinki.
Which is more expensive than I imagined. There is also a bus option -- which
would cost significantly less (and take 27 hours).
