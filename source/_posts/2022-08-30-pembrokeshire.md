I didn't sleep well, I dozed until about 9am then forced myself out of the
sleeping bag and made my way to the facilities to have a morning shower, when
I returned I made my coffee and cereal and read the news on my phone, packed
up my stuff and wheeled the bike off the pitch. The owner was standing close
by "where you going today?" "that's the question!" I said. There was a silence
"only you know how far you can go" "100k" I said, before I realised that he
thought the question was directed at him.

I left the campsite and started climbing a hill, I didn't realise that it
would be the first of many, the first of a continuous wave of ups and downs
that wouldn't stop for seven hours. My ears were ringing and my right ear was
hurting. It was hurting because I put my ear plugs in last night, I put my ear
plugs in because I pitched up next to a tent.

The owners of the tent got in late, and it was only then that I realised how
close I was to their tent. They were cosiderate and quiet, but I simply knew
that the guy would snore. Sure enough, within 10 minutes, the snoring began.

I put my earplugs in, they are the wax kind - 1 inch cylinders of wax. I pushed
them in and they blocked the sound but it wasn't comfortable. When I woke I
took them out and I realised that my hearing still wasn't as good as it
should've been, if I rubbed my fingers together by my ear I couldn't hear any
sound. I assumed the ear plugs had compressed the wax in my ears, over the
next hour my hearing returned to normal, but my ear is tender, probably
shouldn't have pushed the plugs in as far as I did.

My phone was almost out of power, I plugged it into my battery pack only then
to realise that the battery pack was flat. This was a potential problem,
fortunately I'm able to plug my phone into my laptop and charge it from that,
but I would need to stay somewhere where I could charge my battery pack
tonight.

As I was climbing one of the hills I saw a blue plastic sheet on the ground,
as I continued I thought "that looks like a ground sheet for a tent". I
doubled back, and it was. Not only that but it seemed to be the perfect size
for my tent. Since Day 6 I have been using an unwieldy, oversize, black
plastic sheet given to me by the man in the agricultural shop. This sheet was
far more suitable and much more compact.

The most scenic part of today was riding along the perimeter the Pebrokeshire
Coast National Park. There were numerous monuments to Waldo Williams, a poet,
Quaker, Welsh Nationalist and anti-war campaigner.

For lunch I stopped in a village, got some chutney and made my own cheese and
chutney sandwiches on a bench and drank the Ginger Beer I had purchased when I
got of the ferry last night.

The rest of the day was hard. I'd climb a very steep hill, some of the
steepest I've climbed on this trip, only to get to the top, and have an
equally steep descent before being faced with another steep hill. This
repeated over and over again. I had to resort to reciting poetry to keep
myself from going mad, and I only know 2 poems (Ulysses and The Lovesong of
J Alfred Prufrock) so that didn't last long. I used to know 5 or 6 and could
recite for an hour or more. I should learn more.

I arrived at my target, Carmarthen. It was my target because it was the town
at the end of the torturous Sustrans 47 cycle route. I saw earlier there was
an Air B&B for 40 pound, but when I got to the town it was taken. There were
campsites further ahead. I phoned one and I was rejected "I only do seasonal
camping" "it's just a small bike" (I didn't know what seasonal camping was)
"if I do that I'll open the flood gates, sorry take care".

I tried two others but got no answer and decided to go the nearest one, run by
one "Phil". After cycling a further 14k I arrived. Phil was very welcoming and
showed me a place where I could charge my battery pack overnight. "I usually
give cyclists and walkers a discount, what's the most you've paid, £30?" "17
euro" "oh you're lucky, I charge £25 for tents with cars" he charged me £15
including a shower.

It's now 9PM and it's dark. I'm sitting on a pitch, with a good distance from
other tents and I'm typing this on a nearby picnic table. The laptop has 30%
battery. I haven't had dinner yet, and I'm not hungry, but I should probably
cook something.
