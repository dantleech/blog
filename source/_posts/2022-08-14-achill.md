*Rough Route*

I'm now sitting in a pub with a Guinness, the pub is part of a larger facility
that also has a hostel and I've booked in for 2 nights. I'm waiting for a
pizza which I may have ordered a prematurely as I'm not feeling particularly
hungry right now, but it can't do any harm.

Today was a good day, it was cloudy. There is a group of young Irish adults
imitating wolf cries on the next table.

I left my wild campsite at around 8am on an empty stomach and without a
coffee. I slept very well and I felt like lying in a bit longer, but as it was
wild camping I wanted to leave early, even though I don't think I would have
met anybody if I stayed the entire day. I packed all my stuff up at night, so
the tent only had the minimum amount of stuff to pack up.

There was a town which didn't look so far on the map (Béal an Mhuirthead or
Belmullet in English). I had my mind set on an English breakfast (or rather an
Irish Breakfast as they call it here). The town was about 35k however and I
found I had to stop to raid my food bag to replenish my energy. I had some
apple turnovers from 4 days ago, which tasted almost as good as they would have
when I got them, if not better as I was pretty hungry. At the stop the was a
sign describing a folk legend where a Queen had a Heifer and a giant bull rose
out of a lake, made love to the Heifer, and then went mad and jumped through
a mountain, leaving a gap, or at least that's how I read it.

My water was low enough, I had maybe a litre and a half and I made a note to
refill in the town.

*Valley*

I cycled to the town, avoiding the EV1 and making pretty good time, there were
no great hills today and in general I was cycling at a reasonable pace. I
found a Bistro and ordered a vegetarian breakfast and started searching for my
accommodation for the evening.

I noticed a hostel on the map, it was 20k off the route in the wrong
direction, but checking it on Hostelworld, it did have a couple of beds, even if it was
an expensive one (€29 for the 6 bed dorm, €29 for the 12 bed dorm). I decided
to go for it, only after booking did I think to book another night and get a
rest day. The breakfast was satisfying, even if it was a bit smaller than I
needed.

*All signs (road signs too) are in Irish Gaelic*

Feeling good (I had a plan) I paid up and left, I wheeled my bike around the
corner to the supermarket and got some extra food to fill the remaining hunger
gap, as I was checking out I remembered I forgot to refill my water "Strange
question" I said the checkout lady "would I be able to fill my water bottles
in here?" "No" was her succinct and final answer which she felt no need to
elaborate on.

The weather was still cloudy, and I still had a litre. It would be enough and
I left it at that.

I wrode through Ballycroy into a wide valley framed by mountains. The road
inclined gently downwards and I was listening to Led Zeppelin II on my single
ear piece and I felt pretty good.

*More valley*

There was a ferry which would have cut my journey in half, but it went to an
island, from which I would need to take another ferry. And the first ferry
only sailed twice daily, so I figured the chances of me making it across
faster were slim if I wouldn't get stuck there overnight.

I've been developing a very intermittent cough over the past week, which I put
down to the constant exposure to the sun and the dry heat. I feel absolutely
fine, but the cough has been getting deeper. Hoping it will clear up with the
rest day.

I was headed to the island of Achill. I had to cycle south before turning
north again and heading towards the bridge to the island. The wind was blowing
hard (and I could now see I was benefiting from a tailwind earlier). My shirt
was wet, I'm not sure if with sweat or the moisture in the air (it was misty)
and I sensed this probably wouldn't be good for my cough, so eventually I put
my wind breaker on, which saved my chest but made me sweat even more.

*A Greenway (green cycle route)*

Arriving at the hostel I looked for the reception and saw a small door in a
large gate which led to the pub garden. My bike wouldn't fit through and I had
to remove some of the baggage.

When I read that the bunks had reading lights I guessed they would be good
bunks, and I'm not disappointed. They are solid wood. There are basically two
types of bunks: ones that are steel framed and wobble and creak and ones made
of wood which are solid and you feel like you are not in a symbiotic
relationship with your bunk partner.

*Good bunk*

I've now finished my pizza and have about 1/3 of a pint of Guinness left.
There is live music at the pub this evening which I might checkout with
another pint, but after finishing this post I'll probably lie down in the bunk
and read for an hour or two.
