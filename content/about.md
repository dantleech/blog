My name is Daniel Leech. I am a developer since 2007. I currently live in
Dorset in the UK having previously lived in France, Austria and Germany.

I created and maintain 
[a language server](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor)
and [a benchmarking framework](https://github.com/phpbench/phpbench), spend
silly amounts of time on personal projects, and including some other fun
side-quests that I
[actually](https://github.com/dantleech/strava-rs) [use](https://github.com/dantleech/pttlog).

My 18 year career, combined with my programming hobby, has given me a huge
amount of experience in large software projects and their related
technologies and processes.

I am currently available as a contractor, contact me to obtain a copy of my
CV.

You can find me on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@dantleech) and
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-leech-a32851252/).
