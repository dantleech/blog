I have spent the majority of my spare (project) time this month working on
Phpactor, this weekend was my last opportunity to record a song, and I had not
written any lyrics, so on Sunday I decided to just record some music and I had
the Phpactor documentation page open in my browser. The lyrics are mostly
reading the documentation verbatim.

Learnings
---------

I think this song has the best production quality of so far. Again I used
DrumGizmo for the drums, but started by all the channels (there are _16_ of
them) down and then bringing the snare and bass drum up and putting a high
shelf (?) on the kick to give it that famous "clicky" bass-drum sound, I also
put a bit of reverb on the snare.

The main riff is played on two separately recorded tracks and each is panned
hard left and right.

Shredding
---------

Earlier in the month I decided I wanted to learn picking sweep-picking guitar
technique, and I purchased
the [Ultimate Shred Machine](https://www.amazon.de/dp/191126785X/ref=sspa_dk_detail_4) book.

It contains lots of exercises, I've been working my way through the beginning
and although I haven't even started the sweep-picking exercises yet my guitar
playing has improved noticeably and I used some of the techniques in this
song.
