We had an issue today where a CSV file was being read via. `SplFileInfo`.

The array keys were being inferred from the headers, and the values
transformed based on rules per column.

The issue was that the column was not found:

```
// data read from CSV
$data = [ 
   'SALUTATION' => '1',
];
var_dump($data['SALUTATION']); // UNDEFINED INDEX ERROR
```

Very confusing!

It turns out that the CSV file was prefixed with a byte order mark, which was
being incorrectly parsed into the first header (`SALUTATION`).

As we found out using:

```
var_dump(array_map(function (string $key) {
    return array_map(function (string $char) {
        return ord($char);
    }, str_split($key));
}, array_keys($result)));
```

Resulting in:

```
  0 => array:13 [
    0 => 239                                                                                                      
    1 => 187
    2 => 191
    3 => 83 
    4 => 65       
    5 => 76 
    6 => 85 
    7 => 84     
    8 => 65 
    9 => 84      
    10 => 73
    11 => 79    
    12 => 78     
  ]
```

Where `83 .. 78` are the chars for `SALUTATION` and `187`, `191` and `83` are the extra chars.

We googled these numbers and discovered that they are a byte-order-mark, and
removing them fixes the issue.

Not sure _why_ this BOM causes an issue (other files also have BOM but are
seemingly correctly parsed).
