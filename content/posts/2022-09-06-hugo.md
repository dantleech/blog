title: Migrating this site to Hugo

Today I migrated this blog from Sculpin to Hugo.

I created the site originally in 2018 using the wonderful, PHP based,
[Sculpin](https://sculpin.io) static site generator. It has proved to be a
good decision, previously my personal homepages used a database and anything I
wrote on them is lost to history (a tragedy to posterity), now all of my blog
posts are on github, and I can author them locally in my favourite editor.

But over the years it has become _slower_ to compile, I have 138 blog posts
(mostly for cycle touring) and it can take up to a minute to build the site,
especially on my not-very-powerful server.

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a Go based static site generator, which promises
to be much faster so I thought I'd try switching as I had nothing else to do
today.

## Installing Hugo

I was sceptical about installing the Hugo binary - at least with Sculpin I
could do a `composer install` and know that the version of Sculpin I install
would be compatible, where as with a binary there is no constraint.

It was however as simple as `apt-get install hugo` both locally (on the latest
Ubuntu) and on my server.

## Content

Adding content to Hugo was very easy as most of my blog posts are pure
markdown. It was as simple as:

```bash
cp ../oldblog/source/posts/* content/posts/
```

and similar for my assets:

```bash
cp ../oldblog/source/images/* static/images/
```

and so on.

## Theme

The first job was to create a theme. There are plenty of [themes
available](https://themes.gohugo.io/), both paid and free, but after browsing
them for sometime I decided I would try and reproduce my existing site as
closely as possible and hopefully add some enhancements on the way.

For this I started with the [Blank](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/blank/)
theme, git cloning it into the `themes` directory, then I simply deleted the
`.git` directory and developed the theme in-location (rather than messing
about with overriding it).

The `blank` theme comes with no CSS framework, usually I use vanilla [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/) but today I was feeling adventurous and I decided
to try [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Tailwind turns the traditional CSS approach on it's head by making you add
classes to your HTML elements to style them, and in theory you would not even
edit a CSS file.

For Hugo however this didn't work (I can't edit the HTML rendered from
markdown) but I was able to add `@apply` directives to elements in the "input"
CSS file which would "import" the Tailwind styles:

```css
a {
    @apply underline;
    @apply text-blue-900;
}
```

I spent lots of time tweaking the theme, so it's possible slightly better
looking than the original blog.

## URLs

The default URL scheme was different from the Sculpin default. I was able to
fairly easily change the scheme to more-or-less match:

```javascript
{
    "permalinks": {
        "posts": "/blog/:year/:month/:day/:slug/",
        "categories": "/blog/categories/:slug/"
    }
}
```

> Some URLs will be different however as Sculpin used the file name, where as
> Hugo uses the post title.

Sculpin gets the blog post's date from the filename, whereas Hugo gets it from
the "front matter" so I wrote a quick VIM macro to add `date: 2022-01-01` to
the front matter (using the filename to get the date).

## Maps and other customizations

I added a support for rendering routes on [maps and showing bike time and daily
distance](https://www.dantleech.com/blog/2020/08/06/newcastle-to-seahouses/) to my
original blog.

Porting this was relatively simple, I copied the original Twig template then
basically was able to [map the variables and functions](https://github.com/dantleech/blog/blob/master/themes/dantleech/layouts/partials/map.html)
fairly easily to Hugo.

## Audio

Sculpin would render HTML if it was embedded in the markdown, enabling me to
embed an audio player. Hugo does not allow this [by
default](https://www.johnarroyo.com/2021/02/adding-audio-to-hugo/) but I was
able to use a feature the
[shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) feature to
basically create a [HTML macro](https://github.com/dantleech/blog/blob/master/themes/dantleech/layouts/shortcodes/audio.html).

## Building

I created a simple
[Makefile](https://github.com/dantleech/blog/blob/master/Makefile) to run both the `tailwind` command and the `hugo`
command to build the site.

## Summary

Hugo:

- Renders the site extremely quickly.
- The `--watch` flag actually works.
- It hot-reloads the page in the browser on changes.
- Very customizable.
- Built-in "server side" syntax highlighting.

Tailwind:

- Bit weird to start with but gets more comfortable.
- Can still use CSS the CSS way via. the `@apply` directive.

I also managed to make some improvements:

- Posts now show the correct date.
- The home page has a tag cloud.
