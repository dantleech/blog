I have tagged [Phpactor 2024.03.09](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/releases/tag/2024.03.09.0).

The last Phpactor release was about 3 months ago. This release has a large
number of improvements and bug fixes from around 9 individual contributors.

## UTF-16 support

It turns out that the language server protocol expects everything to be in
UTF-16. This was a problem because Phpactor rather expected everything to be
in UTF-8. This problem happened when converting to or from an LSP position.

In LSP positions are provided as `Position(line,character)` where `character`
is the character _offset_ in _code units_. This corresponds neither to byte
offset or to individual characters. For example the code unit for ðŸ˜º has 4 bytes
which is 4 UTF-8 code units, but only 2 UTF-16 code units.

This should resolve long standing issues reported by users using multi-byte
characters.

## Contextual Class Completion

Phapctor now makes _some_ effort to filter classes in the parameter position
when completing. It's far from perfect at the moment

_showing only instances of Widget_

Above the `->widgets` method accepts instances of `Widget` so now Phpactor
will filter the results to only suggest those classes.

More work needs to be done on this feature however.

## Phpactor is killing my CPU: Includes

An [issue](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/issues/2538) was raised which
rather alarmingly claimed that Phapctor was eating up several CPUs at 100%. It
happened on a legacy code base which used many includes and requires and the
user(S) reported that a diagnostics pass couild take up to a minute.

Phpactor has long had some basic support for processing `include` statements
and merging the outgoing frame into the scope where the include was called.

On testing this feature with an example (in Oscommerce) it took around 10
secconds, disabling the `include` processing from Phpactor reduced it to around
4 seconds. I also noticed that the `include` processor really **didn't seem to
work**. None of the expected variables were imported into the frame.

Rather than wasting lots of time trying to fix the include processing that
presumably hasn't worked for years I decided to remove it completely in the
interests of performance.

## Phpactor is killing my CPU: Diagnostics

The other Phpactor (haha) contributing to the performance issues the
diagnostics engine spinning up too many processes and doing this _very
eagerly_.

The language server "diagnostics engine" has been refactored a number of times
since it was created. It turns out that providing non-blocking diagnostics
from a number of sources (e.g. phpactor, phpstan, psalm. php-cs-fixer) is
actually a complete pain in the bum.

The last time it was refactored it was made to be _eager_ and it would
optimistically perform the diagnostics as soon as a document update was
received. Typically this resulted in faster feedback, but obviously it
incldues potential waste as many runs would be invalidated if the text
document had been updated in the time since they were started.

This time the behavior has changed again. Diagnostics will be triggered **after
the user has stopped typing** (i.e. since we recieved an update) for a
configurable amount of time (default 1 second). After that we launch all the
linters in parallel.

In addition we now only process one file at a time and we should be better at
not showing stale diagnsotics (in case you ever noticed diagnostics appearing
for issues that have already been fixed).

## Windows Compatibitliy Improvements

Phpactor has never, to my knowledge, worked with Windows. That is slowly
changing thanks to the work of [@MatmaRex](https://github.com/MatmaRex) who
has made a large effort in the past month to get the tests passing on Windows.

At the point that the tests pass (if we get there) I'll add a CI integration
for Windows and, hopefully, some day, Phpactor will work natively on Windows.

## Phpactor is on the VSCode Marketplace

[@Zobo](https://github.com/zobo) has done an **amazing** job on getting the
[VS-Code Extension](https://github.com/phpactor/vscode-phpactor/commits?author=zobo) on the [visual-studio marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=phpactor.vscode-phpactor).

Hopefully this makes it easier for users to complain about Phpactor. Thanks Zobo.

## Summary

These are just 4 of the 41 changes changes in the
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/releases/tag/2024.03.09.0).
The past 3 months have been relatively busy.

The major pain point with Phpactor continues to be it's static-analysis
performance (although it is basically fine in most cases). I purchased a
[book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Principles-Program-Analysis-Flemming-Nielson/dp/3642084745/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1706982839&sr=8-3) to help provide me with some new insights into program analysis in general.

Unfortunately I have no formal math training, so it's pretty hard going, but
if I skip past the formulas there are lots of good ideas to explore.
