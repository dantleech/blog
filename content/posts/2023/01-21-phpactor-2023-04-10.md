I have tagged [Phpactor 2023.04.10](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/releases/tag/2023.04.10).

It has been almost 3 months since the last tag, part of the reason for the delay
has been the implementation of some great features which required some time to
settle down, and also due to me chasing some [white
whales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Dick_(whales)).

Happily this release _does_ include performance improvements, which will be
noticeable on large and complicated files.

## Diagnostic Outsourcing

By default Phpactor will now run diagnostic analysis in a separate process.
In the previous release diagnostics were a blocking process, and contributed
to poor performance with large files. By running the diagnostics in a separate
process we allow them to be run on a separate CPU, freeing up the main
Phpactor process to do other CPU intensive work.

## Async more things

If you are familiar with the history of Phpactor then you will know it started
off life not as a language server but as a synchronous CLI tool. Over the past
years it has gradually evolved into an almost respectable language server but
there are still lots of relics from the "old days" - lots
of things are blocking which could be non-blocking.

With this release some bottlenecks in the reflection and analysis package
(worse reflection) have been made non-blocking, meaning they can be interrupted and
allow other things to happen while analysing code - notably diagnostics.

## Inlay Hints!

Users of PHPStorm are probably familiar with the concept of [inlay hints]((https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/inlay-hints.html)) -- the
virtual text that is added to your source code to show the parameter names for
functions. Inlay Hints are supported in [Language Server Protocol
3.17](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_inlayHint) and Phpactor's [LSP library](https://github.com/phpactor/language-server-protocol) has been updated accordingly.

Inlay hint support is disabled by default as it can affect performance, it can be enabled with:

```json
{
    "language_server_worse_reflection.inlay_hints.enable": false,
    "language_server_worse_reflection.inlay_hints.params": true,
    "language_server_worse_reflection.inlay_hints.types": false,
}
```

> Inlay Hints _do_ require support in your editor. As of writing [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) requires
an [additional plugin](https://github.com/lvimuser/lsp-inlayhints.nvim) and I
**cannot get this feature working in VS Code at all** so if anybody has any
hints please [raise an
issue](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/issues/new).

## Deprecation Diagnostics

Phpactor now includes a warning diagnostic if you call a deprecated method or
instantiate a deprecated class:

## Auto Configuration

I work on many projects, and I find it annoying to have to customize my
Phpactor configuration each time and often I will not even know IF I can
enable [more
functionality](https://phpactor.readthedocs.io/en/master/integrations.html)
for a given project (does it use Psalm? Prophecy? Behat?).

Autoconfiguration solves this problem by detecting which extensions _can_ be
enabled in the current project and prompting you to enable or disable them.

caption="Auto configuration" width="700">}}

> This comes at the cost of creating a `phpactor.json` file in each project, but
I personally think this is a small price to pay, and I inevitably end up
creating this file regardless.


## Promote constructor parameters

One of my most used Phpactor refactorings has been [complete
constructor](https://phpactor.readthedocs.io/en/master/reference/refactorings.html#complete-constructor) - this refactoring would add assignments and the properties to your class after adding a minimal constructor. 

As of PHP 8.0 we have [constructor property
promotion](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.decon.php#language.oop5.decon.constructor.promotion)
which makes `complete constructor` largely unnecessary, but it is still kindof
annoying to add the visibility.

There is now an additional refactoring `Promote Constructor` which will
automatically add the visibility keywords to unassigned constructor parameters.

## Hierarchical Namespace Completion

This is an overdue and much requested feature, it allow you to enter the start
of an FQN and autocomplete the subsequent sections. It's great for discovering
classes and suggesting for example, all classes with an `Event\\` namespace or
similar.

{{<video src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1621864699712135168/pu/vid/986x540/LvkgSxF5boi3sYTK.mp4?tag=12"
caption="Namespace completion" width="700">}}

## Show class `__construtor` instantiations

Quite frequently I find myself wanting to know all the places where a class is
instantiated via. its constructor (i.e. via the `new` keyword).

You can now invoke the `references` LSP action on a `__construct` method and
it will return all the places where the construtor is invoked.

## Only suggest Attributes for attributes

Previously we suggested _any_ class when presenting suggestion for PHP
Attributes. We now additionally index whether a given class is an attribute or
not - enabling us to only suggest attributes.

## Summaries and Thanks

Since the last release:

- 74 PRs merged since the 21st January
- 102 hours of my time used

Sponsorship:

- I have 10 [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/accounts) and get $181 a month - which is better than a kick up the bum.

Contributors:

- Special thanks to [@mamazu](https://github.com/mamazu) for the many improvements he has contributed, including improving our PHPStan baseline.

NixOS:

- [@drupol](https://github.com/drupol) has created a [NixOS
  package](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=phpactor&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=phpactor)
  for Phpactor and kindly lent me some of his time to explain some
  [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)
  concepts.

## Next Steps

- **Performance** has been addressed in this release, and Phpactor is far better
than it was, but still not ideal. There is more work to do here, hopefully
some low hanging fruits before big scary changes like implementing an
incremental analyser.
- Phpactor's **documentation** is need of attention. It gets frequently
  neglected and I would like to see a more automated approach, especially for
  things like code actions. We could also start to more visibly deprecate
  the use of the VIM Plugin.
- Provide an automated **PHAR build**. This would make it easier to distribute
  Phpactor and cut the dependence on Composer, in addition to having a
  sensible reason to tag releases other than writing a blog post.
