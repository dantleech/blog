I have tagged [Phpactor 2023.09.24](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/releases/tag/2023.09.24.0).

It's been over a month and a half since the last release. As per the last
month I haven't been _very_ active but have managed to contribute various bug
fixes and small improvements, while there have been some great contributions
from [bart-jaskulski](https://github.com/bart-jaskulski) and
[mamazu](https://github.com/mamazu).

## PHPCS Extension

Phpactor has been providing an integration with
[php-cs-fixer](https://github.com/PHP-CS-Fixer/PHP-CS-Fixer) for over a year.
It fulfils the LSP document formatting action, while also providing inline
diagnostics for code-style issues.

PHPCS (PHP Code Sniffer) is the other popular PHP code style linter and fixer.
Thanks to Bart Jaskulski `phpcs` users can now enjoy the same benefits as
`php-cs-fixer` users!

## Subscript/Array-Shape Completion

Phpactor now supports "real" array shape completion:

## Summary

In addition to the two features above there are various improvements and bug
fixes. Mamazu has also spent considerable time refactoring Phpactor to support
LSP ranges but this will be released next time.

That's it ó± ¡
