I have tagged [Phpactor 2023.06.17](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/releases/tag/2023.06.17).

Et voila, on a fait un autre release de Phpactor le serveur de language PHP.

But today is not a day to practice my **bad french**, but to celebrate another
Phpactor release ðŸŽ‰

## Class generic tags

We'll show diagnostics and provide a code action to add (best effort) generic
tags for generics classes:

## Undefined variables and typos

Show diagnostics for undefined variables and provide a code action to fix
typos.

*Diagnostic and suggested fix*

## Auto-reindex

Phpactor's indexer depends on various mechanisms to detect and index files
when they are changed:

- `LSP file events`: If your editor can send file events we use those.
- `inotify`: Linux's CLI tool generally provided by the `inotify-tools`
  package.
- `watchman`: If it's installed
- `find`: If the other two cannot be found

But even if these work (and sometimes they don't) they are subject to failures
and missing file events. Phpactor now supports periodically scanning for
modifications and reindexing, the default is set to 5 minutes.

## PHAR

You can now install Phpactor as a
[PHAR](https://phpactor.readthedocs.io/en/master/usage/standalone.html#phar-installation).

## Documentation

The [splash page](https://phpactor.readthedocs.io/en/master/), [getting started](https://phpactor.readthedocs.io/en/master/usage/getting-started.html) and  and [install](https://phpactor.readthedocs.io/en/master/usage/standalone.html) documentation had not been updated in some
time, I've reviewed and updated them. 


As part of an ongoing effort to automate documentation, all of Phpactor's
diagnostic providers are now self-testing and self-documenting (see [self
testing code
units](https://www.dantleech.com/blog/2023/04/23/self-testing-code-units/)
blog post) and checkout the shiny new [diagnostics
documentation](https://phpactor.readthedocs.io/en/master/reference/diagnostic.html).

## Many more

There are many improvements and bug fixes in this release, see the
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/releases/tag/2023.06.17).

## Contributors

Thanks to [@mamazu](https://github.com/mamazu) for all his hard work in the
psat months and to [@harringsrob](https://github.com/harringsrob) who has been
working on a [laravel
integration](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/pull/1991).

## Summary

The past few months have been busy for me as I've started a new job and have
been enjoying a nomadic life - travelling around and staying with friends and
relatives - while waiting for a flat purchase to complete. I've also been
side-tracked by working on terrible side-projects in Go and Rust.

I haven't got any particular plans for Phpactor for the next months, but my
new job is more focused on PHP than my previous one, so hopefully I can be
inspired!
