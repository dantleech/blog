I was undecided as to whether I would stay another night at the campsite. It
was a friendly, trusting, campsite and they had an area where I could work and
it was a good place for running, but I also knew I couldn't spend any time in
my tent. I was woken up to an already too-hot-for-comfort tent, the sun was
scorching it, and I decided to leave.

*The Path*

Initially I noticed that my leg was stiff from the 11 hours of cycling
yesterday, but when I got back on the bike all was fine and I continued to
follow the cycle path after updating this blog and paying for the camping
(100kr - about €10).

I started the day with music before switching to Norwegian lessons. I did 2 or
3 today and am on lesson 9 now. It shares with German and English and throws
in some more stuff. The accent and delivery sound like how people from Wales
speak (to my ears). The word for two is "two" but the word for one is "et".
Lots of the words seem one step away from the English version.

In general really liking the language so far, although it, like German, has
three genders, it otherwise *seems* quite simple so far.

The cycle path took me across some rugged terrain during the morning, another
"old road" through the country. I passed hikers and cyclists and nodded
"hallo" and "hi". I sat down for lunch in a picturesque spot.

*Lunch*

I was cycling down one of the steep inclines and I could see it going back up
like a wall at the bottom and I could see two cyclists walking their bicycles
down carefully. I tried to cycle up the incline, but it takes me an awful lot
of concentration and I can't multi-task. So when I nod to people or
acknowledge their presence in anyway while I'm cranking up a hill I almost
inevitably end up running the wheel the wrong way and stopping. The best thing
to do would be to ignore the people and concentrate on the climb, but that's
rude. I suppose I could stop at the bottom and shout up hello and announce my
intentions before starting.

I lost control when I nodded at the woman walking her bike down the hill and
she said she wanted to take a picture of me "Do you want me to hold your
bike?" "No, I want to take a picture of you" "OK" I said, as I gingerly span
my pedal back round and announced "it's not so easy to start once you've
stopped" I jumped on and managed to grind up the remainder of the hill the
woman shouted "Bravo!" and I raised my hand in victory and fell off.

I didn't really fall off.

Eventually I left the trail by way of a colourful garden nursery and I had to
decide where I was actually going today.

There was a campsite on the coast, and the city Stavinger inland. I discovered
that there was a HI Hostel very near the city and it cost only €27 per night
for a dorm (as opposed to ~€80 minimum you can expect to pay for a hotel) and
I decided this could be a good time to take a rest day and do some bike
maintenance.

The bike has nothing *new* wrong with it, but as I've been riding it,
especially in the steep terrain, I notice that the gears are not calibrated
properly, to switch up to my highest gear I need to switch down on the front
and then switch back up to the middle in order that the chain is not de-railed
(which happens at least twice a day).

Also my chain is dry (I forgot the lubricant) and the new breaks I put on have
given way a little (probably due to me *fixing* the front bag's bracket, which
was too low and caused the bag to rest on the brake cables making them tighter
than they should have been).

I broke off the path and started along the main road on a direct line to
Stavanger. I was making good time as the wind was behind me and the terrain
was flat, but it was a little disturbing when I could see beast lorries coming
up behind me at speed.  I eventually rejoined the cycle path and rode through
10s of kilometers of boring suburbs.

*It's flat now*

At around 80 I was exhausted, and as I closed in on my target a tendon in
my right leg was causing me some minor trouble. But I pushed on, wishing that
I was there already and never really felt closer to my destination until I
arrived.

The hostel is quite good, the staff are friendly. I am sharing a room with a
Korean called Joe (I think, I havn't asked him where he is from) and there is
a Korean (again, I *think*) family staying here too, and also heard at least
one American. There is a piano in the main room which I might play if there is
nobody around tomorrow.

Half of the hostel are now sitting in front of the television watching
something called football.
