Another good nights sleep and I augmented my breakfast once again, this time
with chocolate milk - Muesli, jam, chocolate milk and coffee. I set out to
follow what officially seems to be the
[EV12](http://www.eurovelo.com/en/eurovelos/eurovelo-12) but is marked on
signs and on my phone as
[EV1](http://www.eurovelo.com/en/eurovelos/eurovelo-1).

I was soon confused having arrived at a closed pedestrian/cycle bridge and
yet all the while seeing people cycling accross it - where were the going? I
wondered. Following them I found the ingress and the cycle path followed the
highway out of the city.

The sun was shining again, but not as fiercely as the previous days, and the
cycle path diverged from the highway and followed an incredibly peaceful road
and I cycled for about 3 hours letting my mind wonder and observing the
Norwegian landscape.

The first thing I noticed was the houses - they are majority of them seem to
be made of wood, with either long vertical or horizontal planks, and often
painted white or red.

Then of course there is the rugged landscape, riding along the coast there are
huge slabs of rock and ample forest. With the wooden houses dotted around,
sometimes 4 clustered in a small valley.

The time is really flying by now. I've done 2 hours before I'm aware of it.
Today I did almost 8.

I stopped at a supermarket, the first I had seen in hours, and was at first
deterred by the business of the place, hundreds of parked cars and people
everywhere (it was a group of supermarket-type shops). But outside my market
was a group of salespeople trying (as I found out) to sell cheaper electricity
to people leaving the shop, so I figured they would notice if anybody tried to
ransack my bike.

Inside I got more muesli, a couple of bananas, a loaf of bread and a can of
beer. I got one of the "cheaper" *cans* of beer, and it cost around €2.15, and
this was a discount market. I think the cheapest one (I found) in Denmark was
about €1.80. In total my shopping cost around €8.

Realising I had forgotten to buy Pasta, I stopped again a few kilometers
further on at a shop next to a lake and got the pasta and a cheap sugary
vanilla pastry. Paying with cash was confusing as I now have a mixture of
Danish and Norwegian kroner, and I had to ask the cashier to sort them for me.
I then sat on a picnic table outside in the sun.

*A Fjord, I think*

A couple of sections were very tough. At one point the cycle path continued
from a perfectly good road up a very steep gravel incline and I wondered if
somebody was joking. I checked my map, and that was indeed the path, so I
clicked down (up?) to my highest gear and started grinding away. This was
around 3 of rough and steep up and down.

Near the end of this section I spied another cyclist heading my way, I could
see a small flag flying behind him. He approached with a friendly smile and we
both stopped and he talked to me in Norwegian and then in English, he asked
where I was going, where I'm from and so on, then told me about his journey.

He has been travelling the coast for 4 months. Starting on the border of Russia above
Finland (he was Finish). First of all he skied, then he used a kayak and now
he is cycling, I looked confused and looked at his bicycle - "Oh, I have a
car" he said. So I guessed he was travelling sections then taking the train
back to his car. He was now on his last leg to Kristiansand where he would get
the train back home.

The last challenge of the day was the first "mountain" of the journey.
Although it was only 260m of altitude (less depending on how high I started)
it was a very steep and long climb. I was ascending at the speed of about
4kmph for stretches of it and rarely rose above 7 with sweat pouring from my
body.

*The top*

After this I decided to stop a bit earlier than anticipated as I had already
done 110km. It was a choice between two campsites, one called "Bibelcamp"
located on the coast, and the other somewhat inland. I choose "Biblecamp"
which I thought might be a christian indoctrination center, but I can't see
any religious symbols anywhere.

It cost only €10 and I have now eaten (lentils and pasta again) and am sitting
under the eaves of the main building with my plugged in to an out-of-door
socket. My powerpack is running a bit low, might see if I can leave it
charging in reception overnight.
