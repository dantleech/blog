I think it was the coldest night so far - relative to my sleeping bag and
comfort level. I didn't sleep great and had a hard time motivating myself to
get out of bed, but eventually I got out and had breakfast, did my business
and left the campsite. I looked for the old man I had spoken to the previous
evening who said, that if he was on reception he would show me the route to
Trondheim. I knew the route of course, because I have a map, but local
knowledge is always good. He wasn't there in any case.

The mountains are getting bigger as I go north, today there have been two or
three descents where I sped up to 50-60kmph.

I diverged again from the cycle route, preferring the more mountainous,
shorter route to the longer (and presumably flatter) coastal route. But the
mountain pass wasn't so high, I measured only 280m, so in all I saved a time
and kilometers.

The first ferry crossing of the day was at Koparnes, when I was 2k from the
port I could see the ferry docking, and I knew I had missed it, but as I
closed in it was still there, and I rode as fast as I could for some distance
before it pulled away. Fortunately they ran every half hour.

The port had a small cabin with a power socket, so I plugged my laptop in and
worked for 20 minutes before jumping on the ferry.

On the ferry a man came round to each car and collected the fare, but he
seemed to miss me, and I had to go inside and find him to give him the fare
(which was around €3.50).

The next section went across one island, and there was a bridge to the next.

My destination today was still unclear, there was a campsite on the second
island, or, there was Ålesund - a largish town and tourist destination which
[burnt down completely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85lesund_Fire) in
1904 and was rebuilt from scratch.

Ålesund was a bit further away, and if I couldn't get a direct ferry I would
need to cycle an additional 25.

Looking at the map, the campsite I had considered was up a 10km dead end, so
I would effectively lose 10km the next day, this wasn't really an option, so I
headed to the ferry port. Best case I could get a direct ferry to Ålesund,
worst case I would have to cycle the extra distance or wild camp.

When I got to the ferry port at Hareid there were road signs to Ålesund, which
I couldn't really understand. There was a regular car ferry, and I asked some
people at the port if it went to Ålesund, and they said it did - but I think
they misunderstood me, as when I boarded the ferry and asked a worker, he said
I should get off and get the _speed boat_ to the right.

There was a waiting area, but I couldn't see any indication that it was for
Ålesund, and I asked several people until I understood that the boat would get
in at 19:00.

The boat didn't cost much, and only took 25 minutes to get to its destination
and it was passengers only (no cars).

In the town I made my way straight to the campsite, there was a Youth Hostel
on the way, but when I asked inside, they had no beds.

When I arrived at the campsite, the man said that they were full, but I could
try and squeeze my tent in front of the reception, by the road, or in the
regular tent place if there is space. It is apparently a very busy time.

Despite him saying that the regular tent place was full, there was ample space
for my tent and bike. They had a kitchen, and I just purchased a shower token
for 10kr (I didn't shower last night because of the fee).

My roaming data allowance has just run out, so now I have no mobile internet
and will be reliant on Wifi until I get back to Germany, but I will be in
Trondheim in a few days, and should be back in Germany in less than a week.

Tomorrow I am going to try and reach Kristiansund.
