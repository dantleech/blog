So I had intended to catch the late sailing from St. Malo to portsmouth today.
As I lay down in my tent the prvious evening I decided it would be a good time
to reserve a ticket, I went to the Condoor Ferry website, selected
`France-UK` and all was going well until it told me the bicycle spaces were
sold out.

This was an inconvenience as there were two possiblities, wake up very early
and take a different ferry which sails at 10:30 or stay a night in St. Malo.
Something within me deeply disliked the idea of rushing to the port in the
morning, so I was left with staying the night in St. Malo and catching the
ferry the following morning. I decided to stay in a hotel as I didn't want to
hang about all day at a Camping, I checked the prices on `booking.com` and it
was expensive - the cheapest hotel being Â£110. 

I had to both book a hotel and book a ferry and make sure that I didn't book a
hotel only to find out the ferry was full (and there was a good chance it
could be). I decided to sleep on it.

In the morning the cheapest price on `booking.com` was now Â£120. 

I didn't want to pay that, it was probably twice as much as I'd paid for all
the camping on the entire trip and something in me deeply resents paying
extortionate prices for accomodation. Then I wondered - what if there are
cheaper prices not on `booking.com`. I googled, and I found the **F1 hotel**,
which, for whatever reason, was not on `booking.com` and which offered rooms
for 70 euro a night. Not cheap, but cheap enough for me.

After booking that I tried to book the ferry, unfortunately the campsite WiFi
was _maddeningly_ unreliable, and after trying to buy the ticket several times with
varying levels of progress (including authorizing the payment 3 times) I was
wringing my head in my hands.

> "did you sleep well?" "yes, actually I did. I didn't expect to,
> but I did".

It was entirely likely the ferry would sell out
and then I would have paid for a hotel for nothing. I tried one more time
(survival bias, I would have kept trying for hours) and finally booked it. I
double checked my emails very much expecting to have booked the wrong dates,
not booked the bicycle, booked the wrong port, to have been invoiced several
times, but... miraculously everything was in order.

*Suspense*

Now my job was done ðŸ˜Œ I had just 30-40k to cycle to St. Malo and the hotel
check-in was at 10:30 and it was 8am. I went back to my tent and relaxed, read
my book and generally just laid there for a few hours. Finally packing up at
10pm and hitting the road again, slowly.

I decided to stop after an hour to get some supplementary breakfast, a coffee
and a Pain au Raisin, coming into the town my way was barred by two police
officers standing on what I thought was the cycle path. Whenever I see police
officers I will automatically do something stipid in an effort to "ACT
NORMALLY AND DON'T BREAK THE LAW" (whatever the law may be). I rode directly
towards them and nodded "bonjour" they moved out of the way. Nothing happened,
but in retrospect I don't think it was a cycle path they were standing on.

*Pain aux Raisin*

I was able to get my supplementary breakfast including a coffee and I sat on
the wall of a church and enjoyed it, then slowly moved on my way while
wandering why for my entire trip the odomoeter had not matched up with the
GPS based recording of my track.

The recorder was only setup to record my position every minute
(in an effort to save battery) so I guess any zig-zagging that happened in a
minute would be translated to a straight line. That _probably_ explains the
discrepency, the other possibility is that the odometer is not configured to
my wheel size correctly as I had to change the battery before I left. I may
never know the truth.

I found the F1 hotel, part of a chain of budget hotels, I almost missed it as
it was not obvious that it existed on the commercial estate. I cycled round
the back and there was nobody at reception and two Norwegians speaking
Norwegian and smoking. "Rooms only available after 14:00". I waited for 20
minutes playing with my phone which connected to the passwordless internet.

Basically I checked in, the room was simple but comfortable. I was a bit
worried about where to put my bike (there was not even a hard-point in the car
park) but the receptionist said I could put my bike in the room. The room
didn't have a bathroom, but had a sink. The only issue is that it's about 4k
from the center, which is a long way for dinner but a short commute to the
ferry with the bike.

"Est-ce qu'il y'a de l'eau piquant" (confused look on her face) "bah, oui" "on a le
brauhrrrauuuedequoi eau" et la "araleauuudeluqoui eau" (consfused look on my
face) "mais c'est quoi le burrreaudeleau de l'eau en fait?" (what the fuck is
that?) "bah, c'est la
marque!" (it's the brand!) "mais, bon, ok, une de ca s'il vous plait" (ok)

In Brest the Pizza guy responded to my "Est-ce qu'il y a du Tabasco?" with "de
l'eau piquant?" so I figured that was what I should order. After the waitress
left I looked at my table and the bottle of what I thought was eau-piqant -
**Chilli Oil**.

I want back in "desole uh, qu'est-ce que j'ai commande?" (sorry what did I
order) "bahh, une pizza, une bier pression" "et?" "et quoi?" "j'ai commende
aussi de l'eau piquant, mais il est la deja, je ne comprende pas" (confused
looks all round) "ok, pas de l'eau piquant alors" (ok no spicy water for me
thanks)

10 minutes later the waitress brought my pizza out, "du coup, ca c'est pas ca de
l'eau piquant" I said gesturing at the chilli oil. "bah non". "ok".

finally we were both very confused and she came out with some sparkling
mineral water "il y a de la boule" (there are bubbles!) "ah! non, c'est bon
merci, tout est bien" (oh how stupid of me, I'm so sorry).

*De l'eau piqaunt (ou pas)*

Tomorrow I aim to be at the ferry terminal at around 9AM, for a long 8 hour
crossing, in which time I'll probably do some programming on my computer and
read my book and sleep.
