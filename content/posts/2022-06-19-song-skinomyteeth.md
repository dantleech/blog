I guess this one is for last month and it's another cover. I've been listening
to alot of Megadeth recently, and got a [tablature
book](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/0793536669/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_image_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1):

## Drums

In previous songs probably the thing that took the longest was programming the
drums. In this cover I saved time by finding a [MIDI
file](https://freemidi.org/download3-5054-skin-o-my-teeth-megadeth) (warning
contians ads).

I imported the MIDI file, muted the other instruments and the drums mapped
almost perfectly to DrumGizmo.

## Guitar

I had some fun with the guitar, using the book as a reference at points. As
with other covers I started by copying the first few bars of the solo then
realised it would take too long so just improvised badly for the remaining
time.

## Vocals

I couldn't quite hit the notes the Dave Mustaine sings with conviction, so I
didn't try. I think I got the chorus pretty well though.
