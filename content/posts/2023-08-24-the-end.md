*Highly Accurate Map*

There was a flash in the sky, followed 30 seconds later by a deep rupturing
grumble from the sky and a gust of wind, but the storm didn't start until
later and the continuous cracking and booming was at least partially the
reason I didn't sleep very well. In the morning I had to decide if I was
hungry or not, and I decided that I was and at 07:30 I walked out in my socks
into the small dinning area of the F1 hotel and helped myself to a pretty good
continental breakfast (especially for the €5 price).

The ferry sailed at 10:30 and I wanted to be there at 9:00 at the latest, it
was only a short 30m cycle to the ferry, I was prepared for the worst, as it
was pouring in rain all night, but when I left the rain was light and it had
stopped completely by the time I got to the ferry terminal. I was welcomed by
the border guard who gave me some words of encouragement ("courageous" I think
he said) and was soon waiting with the motorcyclists and one other cycle
tourist in lane 1 reading my book and not getting a coffee from the shop that
was closed, 20 minutes later we were on board.

I had reserved a cabin for the crossing for €39 as there were "no seats" available
(which would be puzzling if you were to walk around at the huge number of
vacant seats on the ferry), but having a cabin was a good luxury. I could
leave all my gear, sleep for some hours and was able to charge my gear, I also
did a 20 minute work out (push-ups, sit-ups, squats and planks) and had a shower
afterwards.

I did some "work" on my [strava TUI](https://github.com/dantleech/strava-rs)
and read more from my book. I was able to get 2 hours of WiFi by first using
the free hour on my laptop, then using another free hour by using my phone and
sharing the connection with my laptop.

*Beer*

Some 8 hours later I was kicked out of my cabin and I went down to attend to
my bicycle, several other bikes were stacked on top of it and I decided to
wait for the other cyclists, and I sat down on the floor listening to the
oddly satisfying almost deafening deep rumblings, whirrings and screechings of
the ferry's ... well whatever those noises are (hydraulics? docking mechanism?).

I had a small chat with the other, older, cyclist who was curious about my
front panniers and was the second person to ask me about the weight
distribution on this trip "capacity, I got them because of the capacity, but I
suppose it helps with the weight distribution yeah, but I'm thinking of
getting a more lightweight bike like yours, this one is a tank".

*Sitting on the Floor*

We were both going to Portsmouth Harbour train station, he to Waterloo and me
to Weymouth via. Southampton. He suggested we go together, but we got
separated and I cycled to the station alone. I got a ticket for £36. The train
was already at the station (which is a terminal station) but it was locked. I
got a shitty Subway wrap for dinner and waited.

*Bike on Train*


The rest of the journey was uneventful, 1 hour to Southampton, a 10 minute
wait for the Weymouth train, then another 1.5 hours and I was home at 10:20, I
checked my fridge and was shocked that there was no beer in it, so I made a
final cycle ride to the local Co-Op and sat on my sofa and watched 2 episodes
of the "Patriot" on Amazon Prime Video.

And that's the end of this years cycle tour. It was shorter than any previous
tour.

- **No Training**: This tour was another reminder that training - even a 100k
  some weeks previous - is a good idea. I jumped straight into a
  very tough ride to Plymouth on a very heavy bike with a huge number of steep
  hills and fucked up my knee for the next week. It probably would have been
  fine if I was able to work up to it though.
- **No Internet or Phone**: it was quite good to be disconnected and only
  being able to use WiFi when the opportunity presented itself, although it
  was sometimes tricky to publish the blog.
- **Bike is Old**: Like the [guy
  said](https://www.dantleech.com/blog/2023/08/20/day-8-sca%C3%A9r/), my bike
  is _old_. At least it needs some pretty heavy maintenance. I'd consider
  trying something different next time.
- **French**: It was good to practice my French, and I haven't spoken so much
  of it for many many years. It was rusty but it came back to me, like riding
  a bike.
- **Strava**: This is the first time I made GPX recordings. I recorded them on
  [OSMAnd+](https://osmand.net/) (which is the mapping software I've been
  using for over 10 years) with a recording interval of 1 minute. It didn't
  seem to drain the battery problematically. As I had the recordings I was
  able to upload them to [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/112873132).
- **More Batteries**: This year I took 2 power banks with me, and never had to
  resort to charging my phone via. whatever power may have been left in my
  laptop. In all the two power banks could have easily lasted for 4-5 days (or
  longer if I was being more efficient).
- **No Twitter**: For several years I have been publishing my bike tours under
  `@biketourdan` on Twitter but due to the fact they shut down the public
  API and a series of other things I no longer use that service. I have
  instead published on Strava and my personal
  [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@dantleech) account. Maybe next time I can
  find a dedicated bike touring Mastodon instance.

There are probably more lessons to be learnt but that's it for now. Until next
year I guess.
