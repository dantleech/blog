I have now stayed in Tallinn for 5 nights, stayed in two separate hostels,
met lots of interesting people and have been for 4 runs of 10k or more. Time
has passed quicky and I wish I could stay longer but I have to be at work in a
few days.

The first two nights I stayed in the Euphoria hostel, which I breifly
described in the previous post - it has a drum kit, organ, piano, several
guitars, microphones and amplifiers. I spent the days playing piano (either on
my own or jamming), programming (for good or for worse) and running, I was
going to extend in this hostel for 4 for days, but by the time I asked they
were fully booked and I was referred to another hostel and was allowed to
leave my bike in the atic of the hostel.

"Hey, I made a reservation"
"When?"
"10 minutes ago, or maybe 30"
"No you didn't, we're fully booked mate"

I had booked only a single night, not two, and the night I booked was for
tomorrow. The American at the reception was none the less helpful and
funny. Most hostels were fully booked due to a football match and he helped me
find another hostel and cancel the night I did book.

The other Hostel was called the "Imaginary" hostel and was on the other side
of Tallinn, one of the reasons I choose the "United Hostel" was because it was
so close and it wouldn't be much effort to move all of my bags, as opposed to
leaving some stuff behind. The new hostel was at least a kilometer and as I
was hauling several of my bags across the old town I regretted not just
packing bringing my bike from Euphoria.

As it happened it would have been no problem to store my bike in the new
hostel. It seemed to be a new place, and despite there being capacity for
maybe 60 people, there was a large amount of unused space. The first room you
walked into was huge, and had only a small table and chair in one corner, the
rest of the room was being used as bicycle storage for the guests (and there
were several touring cycles), but it would have been easy to convert it into a
bar (perhaps this was the idea). The upstairs was similarly spacious and
afforded lots of places to sociaise with the other guests.

On the first night I fell into a conversation with a French man and a woman
from the Netherlands, we started talking about cycling, and the French guy by
degrees started talking about his life, he was 55 (as I found out later) and
talked about his skiing, cycling, belief (he was a "believer") and life. He
had some good stories, and we left to get a drink, I went to pick up my things and
when I came back they were sitting round a girl and her laptop and watching
the tour-de-france. This was Louize, a 27 year old German student of fine art
who had a passion for glass sculpture, climbing and unicycling (even offroad
unicycling). we went out of the old town and had a drink but didn't stay
out long or drink much as all were quite sensible and it was already getting
late.

The second day I went for a run to the lake in the south, it was meant to be a
21k run, but I was disappointed when approaching the lake that it was fenced
off, and you couldn't even see it behind the trees. It was a large lake (or at
least it was around 15km around) but I was able to run along the fence, which
eventually gave way to some tracks and trails, and it still seemed possible to
run all around it, but as I went further the trail become more overgrown and
there were mosquitoes and then more mosquitoes and when I stopped for a few
seconds they would swarm all over me. I decided to turn back, but still
managed to run around 17km.

That night I joined some of the guests on the sofa, including a retired
American who had travelled the entire length of Russia, he was an architect,
he was talking to a Mexican, Jorge, who was sitting next to an Argentinian
Augustin, and then Luize was sitting on the left. She suggested us going down
to the beach and sitting on this "temple thing" nobody seemed to know exactly
what it was, and I didn't know it existed. Louize, Augistin and I left,
and within 10 minutes we were approaching a somewhat neglected large concrete
construction of some kind.

It had to rows of steps going up on either side of a central block, much like
a temple, as we came up over the last steps we saw a large number of people
sitting at the top and on the mirror image of the stairs going down on the
other side there was a helicopter pan in front of us in front of and between
the steps. I was told informally that it was built as some kind of defensive
structure by the soviets against Finland. It seemed like it had been left to
rot by independent Estonia, and the concrete was falling away and unmaintained,
with rusty steel being revealed from the missing concrete. It was sunset and
we sat and talked.

Police were walking up and down and passively telling people drinking
alcohol that doing so in the open was illegal and moving on, if somebody asked
"what should I do with it?" the police would response "hide it!".

Augustin was from Argentina and was backpacking / hitchhiking to Australia,
he and Louize exchanged hitchhiking stories, the both seemed to have had
extensive experience, unlike me (I've never hitchhiked).

Afterwards we went back to the hostel before Augustin suggested going out for
a drink, so we left and found the "Stinky" bar - which was a small bar in the
old town which featured a square bar backed with rows of drinks and a
large stereo-typical bar tender. We sat and drank a few beers, before walking
back to the hostel, just before the hostel there was a cellar-bar that
Augustin had pointed out on the way up (and in which he met the Mexican guy
getting drunk at three in the morning the previous night). It seemed
convenient so we went inside, ducking under the low door and stairs into a the
bar where again we met the Mexican and there was jazz music playing and there
was a good atmosphere and we stayed and had more drinks. I was quite sozzled
having already drunk two or three beers before we even left.

In the morning I said goodbye to Louize and then to Augustin, Louize lives
not far from Berlin (2 hours by car), so maybe I'd see her again, but probably
not. It's both the interesting and terrible thing about travelling in that you
meet so many people who you will likely never see again in your life. She is
going to the town of Haapsalu to make glass sculptures with a group for a week
before returning to study in Germany.

*An hour later as above*

The hostel itself seemed quite disorganized, the check-in procedure was very
inefficient, and queues of people would be waiting on the stairs (sometimes
complaining and carrying heavy baggage). Indeed when I arrived here the man
mumbled something and asked me to wait for 2 minutes, and 15 minutes later I
was still waiting and not knowing even if my reservation had been made,
meanwhile people had skipped ahead of me. The bathrooms and toilets were,
although new, not cleaned regularly during the day. The kitchen was invariably
left in a mess every day as guests were not pressured to wash up after
themselves, and the dishwasher was forbidden to guests. The beds were of the
worst kind - iron framed bunk beds which transmit all movement from one bed to
the other. Nonetheless socially it was very good.

There were lots of cyclists -- and out of all the ones I talked to, I had done
the least number of kilometers. I met a couple who had cycled on a Tandem from
Slovenia to Kyrgyzstan for 5 months, they seemed to alternate stories
depending on who they were talking to, telling me who beautiful Armenia was,
and how the people were so open and kind, to somebody else telling me how
they had a really bad time there as they got diarrhea from the water in the
food that the people freely gave them. So I guess in sum they had a great
adventure and they both looked quite weather beaten (the guy apparently hadn't
slept in 24 hours for whatever reason).

Another tourer from London had been travelling by bicycle for 11 months,
cycling France, Spain, South America, Australia, New Zealand, and all with a
surf board. As I walked back into the hostel once I was amazed to see a
bicycle with a surf board mounted on one side of it, giving the handlebars
just enough space to rotate and legs to pedal. He had travelled for 11 months
on a surfing bicycle.

I went back to the Euphoria hostel, and was soon jamming again. Today my time
has been mostly spent worrying about how I will get back to Berlin.

Initially I had thought to get a bus - the most simple if not quickest option.
It would cost â‚¬70-100, but I needed to find out what the situation would be
with my bicycle, I went to the office this morning and was told flatly "No you
cannot take bicycle" "It says on your website that I can with permission"
"Then you must ask for at main office in Riga, you want email?"

I phoned the main office directly afterwards and was again flatly told "no"
before she explained that with written permission it was possible, but it
would take three working days. This wasn't really acceptable for me, as it
could be denied and I would be missing more days of work.

*Jamming*

So then there were flights, and the ferry. The flights were also not as
expensive, and it seemed possible that AirBaltic would take my bike without it
even being packaged (air out of the tyres, pedals off, seat down, etc), this
was probably the best option (even if I had to change planes at Riga), but I
hate flying so ... the ferry was not as expensive as I had first thought
had thought, and getting the ferry was always the original plan.

I booked the ferry, for 17:00 the next day (tomorrow) and thought that this
gave me ample time to cross the Baltic Sea to Helsinki in another ferry. There
was a crossing at 12:00 which got in at 14:30. But apparently the check-in
closes two hours before 17:00, giving me only 30 minutes to get off the ferry
and find the new ferry, which may or may not be an easy thing, and there is
also the chance (I don't know) that the ferry could be delayed, so it was
tight.

The only alternative was the 06:00 or 08:00 sailing. The 08:00 gets in at
10:30 and would mean I would need to be at the port at around 07:00 or before,
and leave the hostel at around 06:30, getting out of bed around 06:00, which
is fine, but if I somehow miss the ferry, it could mean throwing the â‚¬250 I
spent on the non-refundable ticket to Germany down the drain.

Then the next problem was that the ferry will arrive in Germany at around 21:30
- giving me no chance to check in to a campsite, the nearest hostels are in
Lubeck (>10km away), and check-in closes at 11. I didn't want to spent â‚¬100
or more on a hotel for a few hours before getting up in the morning to get a
train.

I thought about what to do, and did actually find a hostel in the northern
direction closer to the ferry port, but when I called them up on the telephone
they were fully booked. I considered cycling to Rostock by night, but wrote it
off as I would arrive at 03:00 or 04:00 in the morning and wouldn't be able to
find a place to stay ... but then it occurred to me that the trains might be
running.

I could cycle to Rostock at night directly from the ferry port, arriving
around 3 or 4am and the first train to Berlin (with changes) is at around 4am.
This would be a nice way to finish the tour. Now all I need to do is get up on
time and hope that everything runs smoothly.
