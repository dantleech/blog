As normal I slept not to well on the campsite, but woke up at 06:00 and made
breakfast (coffee, porridge, and some pastry things I found in a shop) and was
out on the road at around 08:00 heading to the Latvian border.

It looked to be another sunny day, yesterday I had worn my vest for the first
time since being burnt over a week ago, and was annoyed that I had burnt again
in the same place, I sprayed some sun lotion on to my back and put on my shirt
instead of the vest.

I headed north-north-east passing lots of lakes including the town of Dusetos,
making my way 50km to the Latvian border where I crossed to the Latvian town
of Subate. It was now 11:30, and I pulled off the main road and cycled to the
center of the village, found the (super)market and purchased a beer and some
peanuts, before sitting down on a bench in the nice green square and making
lunch (hard cheese blocks in dark bread pasted with peanuts peanut butter to
hold the peanuts in place). I also got some chocolates which was dangerous as
all 6 were quickly dispatched and I decided buying chocolates is always a bad
idea.

*Latvia*

I idly looked up the Wikipedia for what now seems to be a village, it used to
be a larger settlement of around 2,300 people in 1914, now it has only 940,
it's entire Jewish population was murdered during WW II.

I had an option in around 10km of either turning west and finding a place to
stay in the 2nd biggest city in Latvia, Daugavpils, which would have made
around 100km, but I decided against it when I couldn't see any affordable
accommodation, and decided instead to head towards Riga and build up some more
spare days.

After passing the point of no return I listed to an audiobook, I thought I had
"Bill Brysons Short History of almost Everything", but instead I had Howard
Zinn's "A Peoples History of the United States" and I spent 4 hours listening
to 4 chapters: How women were oppressed, How the Indian lands were taken, The
Mexican War (invading Mexico), and a chapter about the abolition of Slavery and
the civil war, but to be honest my concentration was waning at this point. But
it passed a great deal of time.

*Lots of lakes around these parts*

It wasn't at all clear where I would rest tonight, Jekabpils was the logical
place a largish city, at around 130km, but there didn't seem to be any
accommodation or camping there. If I couldn't find any accommodation there then
there was a town 15km further on which ostensibly offered a campsite and some
motels.

The road today was extremely flat after some initial hills, passing into
Latvia I noticed a number of what I guess are nuclear bomb shelters in
peoples gardens.

*One of three back-garden bomb shelters I saw today*

The road was mainly surrounded by forests, at one point this changed to a
massive clearing of freshly dug earth, it looked as if an enormous amount of
forest had been cleared and the earth turned over.

*Missing trees*

I passed through Jekabpils without seeing any accommodation (I did see a
Motel on the way out, but it was on the wrong side of the road, and anyway it
was raining and somehow I had already decide to ride to the next town). It
started raining and I hit a main road to Riga.

There was no other option that to take the two lane road with it's traffic and
lorries. Unfortunately there are no asphalt hard-shoulders in either Latvia or
Lithuania  (possibly also Poland) only gravel which is not fun to cycle on,
and possibly even dangerous if attempting to pass over it at speed. This is
where my mirror comes in handy, and with constant attention I can ride on to
the hard shoulder when big lorries burn past without risking a close shave.

Around this time my phone battery died, but the way seemed clear enough in my
memory and I crossed a bridge and turned left, following the lake that the
town of Plavinas lives on, and started looking for the hotel. Without my
phone's GPS I wasn't sure exactly where I was going, and I asked a local, who
happened to be a kid of around 14, and he spoke English and was able to
respond to my question negatively when I asked him if there was a Hotel in
either direction.

*Approaching rain*

I carried on down the road, and went to the effort of connecting my phone to a
battery and found the Motel I had seen on it in the morning, I headed to it,
but couldn't see any motel, then looking around more closely there was a dirty
house with "Motels" written on it, but it didn't look like anybody was home
and I might find a better place later so I continued, there was another Motel
and then the campsite.

The next Motel also looked empty, there were no cars out front, and I could
see no movement or lights (although it was day). I pulled up, there was a bar
building on the left, and the "Motel" on the right. I tried the door to the
motel, it was open, and I went upstairs, and said "Hello?" but there were only
rooms. When I came back down there was a lady that had appeared from the bar
"Do you speak English?" she shook her head and beckoned me to follow.

The lady knew a few words of German, and assumed that I was German, and was
surprised that I was English when she checked my passport. She's a little
strange, but very accommodating and she ensured that my bike was secure and
inside (she wouldn't let me leave it in the car park locked up). She called my
"Thomas" for a good while, which was fine, until she asked if that was my
name, and I said "Daniel, but Thomas is also fine!".

She later entered the bar holding her cat "Daniel!" (she starts most
sentences addressing me with either "Thomas!" or, now, "Daniel!") This is my
cat, tiger" (or similar).

The room is quite expensive, €38, including breakfast. I had hoped to pay more
in the line of €20, and I probably wouldn't have stopped if I had known the
price (the campsite should be just another 100m down the road). But it's fine,
I only paid €4 for the campsite last night and the breakfast should be good
for the push tomorrow to Riga.

After crashing out for an hour, I came down to the bar and ordered dinner -
explaining that I was vegetarian, I was going to order chips and cheese, but
instead the lady recommended dumplings. In the end I had dumplings with
mayonnaise, a beer, and some bread.

I will stay at least 2 nights in Riga, the length of time I spend depends on
how much I like the hostel (assuming I find one), I would be quite happy to
spend a bit more time there if it's good.

My bum is sore to the point approaching uncomfortability for the first time,
perhaps it's the accumulation of the past two weeks, or just doing two 8 hour
days back-to-back.
