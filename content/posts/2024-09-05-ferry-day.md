Now I'm in my expensive overnight cabin feeling slightly hungry and aware that
soon I will have no more internet so writing this one up quickly.

_For everybodies confort and to save you batteries can all car passengers ensure
that they turn their alarms off and put their handbrakes on_

My teenage dorimitory companions were not the antisocial punks that I had
feared them to be, they were not even the partying ones, but they were German.
They arrived very quietly and made every effort not to disturb me. Which was
hard however as any movement on the bottom bunk caused the top bunk to shake
and squeak, but I appreciate their efforts. Nonetheless I slept well enough.

The dormitory had a large glass window which looked out from the 4th floor of
a large building on a hill overlooking the motorway which wasn't as ugly as it
sounds with the mountains in the background. The window was open and the white
noise of the cars was actually a welcome mask for any rustling, squeaking or
snoring that might be heard.

Breakfast was included and served from 8 until 9 and it seems everyone in the
hostel was there a not isignificant number of people were engaged in serving
the guests a single piece of bread and ensuring that the butter, marmelades,
yoghurts, fruits etc didn't run out.

The ferry to Portsmouth UK was booked the night previously, what I didn't
account for was that it would arrive at 21:00. This is unfortuantely late and
would give me 45 minutes to go from the port to the trainstation in order to
get the train first to Southampton then to Weymouth. There was a subsequent
train but it only went as far as Bounremouth, leaving me 35 miles from my flat
at midnight meaning I would probably get home at 3am to 4am.

Other options included hotels - but the prices are silly - and there are no
hostels in Portsmouth or Southampton that I could find. Fortuately I have
cousins in Lee-On-Solent and was able to arrange a sleep over. That done I ha
time to kill as the boat left at 7pm.

I went for a walk, being more prepared for the rain this time by not wearing
my best shorts and shirt. I walked to the [Guggenheim Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guggenheim_Museum_Bilbao) with it's famous
floral cat (yes it's still there) while answering birthday greetings.

The museum is a massively impressive building that doubtless contains some
mighty impressive art, but not being particularly knowledgable about art and
less than eager to depart with €17 I decided against entry. Instead I
retreated to a bench and slouched dejectedly and reflected on a plan of action.

I decided to take a longer walk back to the hostel along the esturary and then
make my way to the port - which is actually some 18km from Bilbao. It had been
raining when I left, there was a brief period of sun, before it clouded over
and started raining again. I passed another museum - the
[Itsasmuseum](https://itsasmuseum.eus/en/) which is a maritime museum and most
importantly it cost only €7 so I went in.

It was quite interesting getting a very superficial overview about how the
city of Bilbao developed over the centuries and then to see models of some of
the ships that had been built there although as with all museums I was
chronically tired after 45 minutes and skipped through the last exhibits.

There was lots of construction happening and very occasionally the museum
would shake with a deep "boom" due to what I think was tunnel construction. The
rattling of pneumatic hammers was ringing in the air almost continuously and
in other places new high-rise buildings were being errected.

On the way back to the hostel I stopped for a totilla and a coffee before
going back to the hostel to get my bike, waiting over 20 minutes in the queue
to do so then it was a case of finding the cycle path and going north to the
port.

As I cycled out along the estuary I reflected that Bilbao really is a big
city, even bigger than Weymouth. It's also very colourful and green. When I
cycled in the previous day I was reminided of artists representations of
utopian cities. Large car-free common areas with flowers, trees, bushes, water
fountains, children playing, skateboards, rollerblades, bicycles and
_activity_.

As I approached the ferry port in the rain I made a point to stop at a
supermarket and get some supplies. I would be on the ferry for dinner,
breakfast, lunch and dinner again and I wasn't going to pay for all of them (I
am prepared to pay for breakfast however).

Borading the ferry was straight-forward. There was some waiting in the rain
but as I arrived with "only" 2.5 hours to spare I think I waited no more than
an hour before being boarded with 5 other cyclists.
