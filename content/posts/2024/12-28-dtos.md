In my previous post I talked about [Value
Objects]({{< ref "11-24-php-value-objects-and-you" >}}) in this post I will
talk about DTOs - **Data Transfer Objects**.

As a disclaimer the contents of this blog post represents my current opinion
and any abuse aimed at you, the reader, is purely rhetorical.

Identifying a DTO
-----------------

The following statements are always true:

- DTOs are intended to be **serialized** and/or **deserialized**.
- DTOs do not have **business** logic[^nobusiness]

And I would consider the following statements to be **virtuous**:

- DTOs are **read-only and final**.
- DTOs **only** have public properties.
- DTOs have **no getters or setters**.
- DTOs contain **only primitive types or other DTOs**.
- DTOs are **not responsible** for their own serialization and
  deserialization.
- DTOs do not penetrate beyond the **frontiers of your application**.
- DTOs are **exact representations** of the incoming or outgoing data.

What is a DTO?
--------------

Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are used to give structure to the input
and output of your application and incidentally enable you to decouple the
input and output from your business model.

DTOs can be created **from** and/or converted **to** an unstructured
representation, typically an `array` in PHP.

Below we have a DTO representing a sporting activity from the
world renowned Sportster Sports Activity Tracking Internet Application:

```php
class SportsterActivityDTO {
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        public string $date,
        public float $distance,
        public float $time
        public ?float $averageHeartRate
    ) {}
}
```

We get the following data from the Sportser API:

```php
$array = [
    'title' => 'Run along the Esplanade',
    'date' => '2018-02-20T18:02:13Z',
    'distance' => 10000,
    'time' => 2700,
]
```

We then use a mapper library to _map_ this array data to the DTO:

```php
$dto = Mapper::create()->fromArray(SportsterActivityDTO::class, $array);
var_dump($dto->title); // prints "Run along the Esplanade"
```

We can also map the DTO _back_ to an array:

```php
$newArray = $mapper->toArray($dto);
var_dump($newArray == $array); // prints "true". we converted the DTO back to the original form.
```

{{< callout >}}
You may also see `toArray` and `fromArray` methods on DTOs themselves in the
wild, or maybe even `toJson` and `fromJson`. While this would have made this
blog post easier to write I think this is **BAD** and we'll find out why
later!
{{< / callout >}}

From now on I'll be using the term "serializer" instead of "mapper". They are
essentially the same thing but serializer can be understood to transfer to and
from bytes (i.e. a `string`) rather than arrays.

Example Sportster API
---------------------

Let's use the famous Sportster Developer API to fetch an activity badly and persist it to our database:

```php
// badly fetch the JSON data from the API and decode it to a PHP array
$activity = json_decode(file_get_contents('https://sporster.example.com/activity/11'), true);

// badly insert the activity into the database
$database->exec('INSERT INTO activity (
    id,
    title,
    date,
    distance,
    time,
    averageHeartRate
) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)', [
    $activity['id'],
    $activity['title'],
    $activity['date'],
    $activity['distance'],
    $activity['time'],
    $activity['average_heart_rate'],
]);
```

Focus on the bad `$activity` - the code has no way of knowing:

- if `$activity` is an array.
- if `$activity` has all the required keys.
- if the types in `$activity` are the expected types.
- if any of the fields in `$activity` are optional.

What's worse is that **YOU** have no way of knowing what's in the bad
`$activity`! We _think_ it _should_ have the keys we're accessing but there
are no guarantees. Let's add some assertions:

```php
// fetch the JSON data from the API and decode it to a PHP array
$activity = json_decode(file_get_contents('https://sporster.example.com/activity/11'), true);

if (!is_array($activity)) {
    throw new Exception('Expected an array!');
}

$requiredFields = ['id', 'title', 'date', 'distance', 'time'];
$missingFields = array_diff($requiredFields, array_keys($activity));
if ($missingFields) {
    throw new Exception(sprintf('Activity is missing fields: %s', implode(', ', $missingFields)));
}

if (!is_string($activity['id'])) {
    throw new Exception(sprintf('ID must be a string, got: %s', get_debug_type($activity['id'])));
}

if (!is_string($activity['title'])) {
    throw new Exception(sprintf('Title must be a string, got: %s', get_debug_type($activity['title'])));
}

// check all the other types
// ...

// insert the activity into the database
$database->exec('INSERT INTO activity (
    id,
    title,
    date,
    distance,
    time,
    averageHeartRate
) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)', [
    $activity['id'],
    $activity['title'],
    $activity['date'],
    $activity['distance'],
    $activity['time'],
    $activity['average_heart_rate'] ?? null,
]);
```

Not **quite so bad**. By the time we get to inserting our data into the database **we
are safe**. But that was lots of work! We've written lots of **boilerplate**.
Writing boilerplate doesn't scale:

- Boilerplate is **time consuming** ⏰.
- Boilerplate is a **breeding ground for bugs** 🐛.
- Boilerplate is a **code smell** 💩 _and don't let anybody [gaslight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting) you into a
  different opinion._

And if we want to use our `$activity` somewhere else:

```php
function analyse_activity(array $activity): ActivityAnalysis
{
    // ...
}
```

Oh shucks! We would need to validate `$activity` all over again[^arrayshapes]! But Dan! for fuck's
sake **use a class already**!

You're right - **damn you**. Let's go back and use a DTO and a serializer:

```php
// fetch the JSON data from the API and decode it to a PHP array
$data = file_get_contents('https://sporster.example.com/activity/11');

// use a serializer to decode the JSON and map the data to a DTO class
$activityDTO = $jsonSerializer->deserialize(SportsterActivityDTO::class, $data);

// insert the activity into the database
$database->exec('INSERT INTO activity (
    id,
    title,
    date,
    distance,
    time,
    averageHeartRate
) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)', [
    $activityDTO->id,
    $activityDTO->title,
    $activityDTO->date,
    $activityDTO->distance,
    $activityDTO->time,
    $activityDTO->averageHeartRate,
]);
```

**Oh boy** that's less code! It's almost the same amount of code as when we
did no validation at all!

- We have a strongly typed object - the DTO.
- The serializer should fail **usefully** and provide _better_ explanations than our
  custom validation did.
- The properties of the DTO are available statically.

This is better code, especially in the context of this example, but in a real
application we would probably **not want the DTO to penetrate to the persistence
layer**.

{{< callout >}}
I've been using the term "serializer". The simple fact is that you _need_ one
to work with DTOs in the way I am presenting in this article.
Unfortunately there is no canonical solution in PHP, here are some representative
libraries:

- [Symfony Serializer](https://symfony.com/doc/current/serializer.html): It
  _mostly_ works the way you expect. Quite fast, doesn't support generics, doesn't throw _structured_ errors.
- [Valinor](https://valinor.cuyz.io/latest/): Bit slow, supports generics and
  other advanced types via. existing type annotations, throws structured
  errors.
- [Object Mapper](https://github.com/thephpleague/object-mapper): Much faster (generates code), no generics, worst error messages.
- [Symfony Form Component](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/form.html): HTML form
  mapping library.

There are many other libraries out there including the classic [JMS Serializer](http://jmsyst.com/libs/serializer/master/reference/annotations#type) and the new [Serde](https://github.com/Crell/Serde) package.
{{< /callout >}}

## Mapping to Entities...

In our application we have an `Activity` _entity_ that's managed by an
[ORM](https://www.doctrine-project.org/):

```php
$activityEntity = new Activity(12, 'Park Run', new DateTimeImmutable('2024-01-01'), 5000, 1260);
$orm->save($activityEntity);
```

That's sure better than writing all that SQL and we have an rich domain object - an **entity** - where we can use [value objects]({{< ref "11-24-php-value-objects-and-you" >}}):

```php
$activity->title() // "Park Run"
$activity->distance()->asMiles(); // 3.1
$activity->time()->asStopwatch(); // "21:04"
```

I know what you're thinking! **LET'S MAP TO THE ENTITY INSTEAD OF THE DTO**:

```php
// no no no no no no no
$entity = $jsonSerizliser->deserialize(ActivityEntity::class, $json);
```

**NO**. We do not want our domain object to be coupled to the Sportster API. This will not scale:

- Sportster **changes penetrate into the core of our application**. That's bad!
- We inherit any idiosyncrasies of **their** API in **our** model.
- It makes adding non-Sportster integrations **exponentially harder**.

Our **entity** should be modelled to **our** application. **Leave to Sportster what
is Sportster's**. This is about **ownership**. This is Sparta. **This DTO** is not ours even though we created it.

Instead we map the DTO to the entity:

```php
$sportsterDTO = $jsonSerializer->deserialize(SportsterActivityDTO::class, file_get_contents('https://sportster.example.com/activity/1'));

$activity1 = new Activity(
     $sportsterDTO->title,
     new DateTimeImmutable($sportster->date),
     $sportsterDTO->distance,
     $sportsterDTO->time,
);
$orm->save($activity1);

// Runner is another imaginary sports tracking platform
$runnerDTO = $jsonSerializer->deserialize(RunnerDTO::class, file_get_contents('https://runner.example.com/activities/1234-1234'));
$activity2 = new Activity(
     $runnerDTO->title,
     new DateTimeImmutable($runnerDTO->date),
     $runnerDTO->distance,
     $runnerDTO->time,
);
$orm->save($activity2);
```

## ...with DTOs

In the previous example we instantiated the `Activity` Entity inline, which is at best annoying. I like to shift the `DTO <=> Entity` mapping to the DTO itself:

```php
$sportsterDTO = $jsonSerializer->deserialize(SportsterActivityDTO::class, file_get_contents('https://sportster.example.com/activity/1'));

$activity1 = $sportsterDTO->toActivity();
$orm->save($activity1);

$runnerDTO = $jsonSerializer->deserialize(RunnerDTO::class, file_get_contents('https://runner.example.com/activities/1234-1234'));
$activity2 = $runnerDTO->toActivity();
$orm->save($activity2);
```

This approach **couples the DTO to the Entity** which I think is **fine** because
the DTO is not our core domain. If we were to do the opposite and couple the
Entity to the DTO that would be (rather) **WORSE** as the entity would have knowlege about
all our integrations.

This pattern also works the other way around:

```php
$dto = RunnerDTO::fromActvity($activity);
```

All roads lead **to** the domain, not from it, which is another
way[^anotherway] of saying
that anything can depend on the domain model, but the domain model **should not
depend on anything**[^anything].

## Web APIs

Until now we are using DTOs to represent a payload from a vendor's web API,
you'd commonly also use this pattern in your own web API:

```php
class ActivityController
{
    // ...
    public function get(string $activityId): Response
    {
        $activity = $this->repository->get($activityId);
        if (!$activity) {
            throw new HttpNotFoundException(sprintf(
                'Activity "%s" not found', $activityId
            ));
        }
        $dto = ActivityDTO::fromActivity($activity);

        return new Response(200, json_encode($dto));
    }
}
```

In this case it's good to think of the DTO as being **owned by the end-user** of
your API. You _could_ change the DTO's structure, but you'd make your users
very unhappy indeed. The DTO provides a **stable representation** of your
data while the underlying **model** can change. Your users like stability. **Be
nice to them**.

{{< callout >}}
**Why didn't you use the serializer to serialize that DTO to JSON insead of
`json_encode`**, Dan? You
probably _should_ use a serializer but I want to highlight that if you have a
"pure" DTO made of public properties, primitives and other DTOs then **you
don't need to**. `json_encode` will work just fine.
{{</ callout >}}

## Attributes are Fine

I think using Attributes **in DTOs** is fine 🥳 - however there is a general
reluctance to do so on the basis that it couples the class to an external
library. The argument is valid in as much that it mixes the concepts
from a third-party library into your core domain. But DTOs are **not part of
your core domain**.

DTOs live
at the frontiers of your application and they are your first line of defense
from the **harsh realities of the world**.

Examples of metadata you _may_ want add to your DTO:

- [Open API Tags](https://zircote.github.io/swagger-php/guide/attributes.html): You may be generating DTOs and API clients from an Open API spec otherwise you can add Open API metadata to your DTOs to provide information that cannot be reverse engineered from the class structure.
- [Serializer Metadata](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/attributes.html#serializer): For example path mappings. I've tried to dissuade you from having a DTO that would _require_ any additional serializer metadata but it can often make sense[^sometimes].
- [Validation
  Constraints](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/constraints.html):
  User facing validation.

"Should I feel bad about using attributes", a guide:

- **Entities**: Yes, quite bad[^entity]
- **Value Objects**: Yes
- **Collections**: Yes
- **DTOs**: No

## Validation

You ~~may~~ should want to **protect** your _**Entity**_ classes from **dirty** third-party libraries such as
validators. Your core business model should not be concerned about the user
interface and validation messages are _for the user interface_ whether
that be a HTML or JSON response.

DTOs are are often the place to add user-facing validation rules:

```php
use Validator\Constraints;

final readonly class NewActivityDTO {
    public function __construct(
        #[Constraints\NotEmpty()]
        public string $title;

        #[Constraints\GreaterThan(0, message: 'Distance must be greater than 0')]
        public int $distance;

        // ...
    ) {}
}
```

{{< callout >}}
But **Dan** - I read a [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) book and it says that my entities and value objects should
_also_ be responsible for ensuring that they have valid state. Does this mean
I need to apply the **same rules in two places?**

Having the same validation in two or more places is a problem for sure (hi
Javascript password validation! 👋) but the assertions used in entities and
value objects are different from validation rules targeted at the user's interface.

Value Objects and Entities _guard_ their state. It's impossible to have a
negative `Distance` for example, so a `Distance` value object should throw an
exception when that is the case. `Distance::fromMeters(1)` is a valid
distance - **it won't break anything** - however if you're recording a bicycle ride, then maybe you forgot
to add some zeros and the user interface could tell you to correct your
mistake.

Sometimes you will duplicate validation rules between the user interface and
the domain. Sometimes you may want to _use_ the domain to inform the user
validation but the _domain_ shouldn't be aware of the user interface.
{{</ callout >}}

## No `fromArray`, no `toArray`, no.

One terrible and common pattern in the wild is `toArray` and `fromArray`:

```php
$dto = SportsterActivityDTO::fromArray(json_decode($payload, true));
```

or even:

```php
$dto = SportsterActivityDTO::fromJson($payload);
```

That's **neat** right? What's wrong with it, **Dan**?

```php
final readonly class SportsterActivityDTO {
    // ...
    public static function fromArray(array $array): self
    {
        if (!isset($array['id'])) {
            throw new Exception('Invalid data');
        }
        if (!isset($array['title'])) {
            throw new Exception('time is missing');
        }
        if (!isset($array['distance'])) {
            throw new Exception('time is missing');
        }
        return new self($array['id'], $array['title'], $array['dstance'], ...);
    }
    // ...
}
```

That's wrong. In the above code we have at least the following problems:

- The first error message is too general.
- The second error should be `distance is missing` and not `time is missing`.
- The third error is the same as the second.
- We access `dstance` instead of the checked `distance` key.
- This ~~boilerplate~~ technical-debt scales up linearly by the number of DTOs.

In short, this shit code is **RIPE** for bugs and misleading errors. It's also
something that can be **totally automated** because the DTO class definition
provides **all the information that is required**:

```php
class SportsterActivityDTO {
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        public string $date,
        public float $distance,
        public int $time
        public ?float $averageHeartRate
    ) {}
}
```

A mapping or serializer library can look at this class and infer the following
schema:

| Field | Type | Optional? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | string | no |
| `date` | string | no |
| `distance` | float | no |
| `time` | int | no |
| `average_heart_date` | float | yes |

By using that schema we can map to our DTO:

- **constistently**: error messages will all have the same format, field names
  map exactly to property names.
- **accurately**: error messages will **not** have typos or ommit field names.
- **configurably**: you have one place to decide which [case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) to use.

In short **mapping from unknown sources** is a hard problem. You shouldn't
try to solve it. Provide a _schema_ in the form of the DTO and let a
serializer library
do it for you.

{{% calloutbl %}}
One exception here might be if you **generate your DTOs**, if you generate your
DTOs then having `fromArray` and `toArray` is more acceptable as the
serialization logic is contained in the code generator, just make
sure the generated code is not committed to your git repository and that you
are not [Beezlebub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beelzebub), oh wait **you
ARE** aren't you.[^beezlebub]
{{% /calloutbl %}}

```

## No Entity Serialization

One pattern that was early some years ago was mapping requests directly to
entities instead of using an intermediate DTO:

```php
$activity = $jsonSerializer->deserialize(ActivityEntity::class, $array);
```

This is **bad** because our internal `ActivityEntity` representation is coupled to the external representation. Worse - it could be coupled to multiple representations:

```php
// don't do this
// using attributes to add metadata to tell a serializer how to map
// different representations to and from the entity.
class ActivityEntity
{
    private int $id;
    #[SerializedProperty('id', group: 'Sportster')]
    private int $externalId;
    public function __construct(
        #[SerializedProperty('title', group: 'Sportster')]
        #[SerializedProperty('name', group: 'Runner')]
        private string $title,
        #[SerializedProperty('distance', group: ['Sportster', 'Runner'])]
        private int $distance,
        // ...
    ) {}
}
```

This is fine right?! No! You like it? I don't. **But wait**: we want to use a
`Distance` Value Object:

```php
class ActivityEntity
{
    // ...
    public function __construct(
        // ...
        #[SerializedName('distance', group: ['Sportster', 'Runner'])]
        private Distance $distance,
        // ...
    ) {}
}
```

Oh no, more complexity! We'll have to tell the serializer how to serialize
`Distance`[^serialize].

{{< callout >}}
The more likely outcome is that the developer will **NOT** use a value object
here **because** of the difficulty of serialization. This is a great example
of third-party libraries falsely informing our domain design.
{{< /callout >}}

It's better to create a simple DTO for each representation and map the DTO explicitly to the entity.

```php
new Activity(
    externalId: $runnerDTO->id,
    title: $runnerDTO->name,
    distance: Distance::fromMeters($runnerDTO->distance),
    // ...
);
```

The hardest part **isn't** the above code. The code above is _safe_,
_maintainable_ and _boring_. The hardest part is converting unstructured data to a
DTO.

{{< callout >}}
I won't say anything about mapping value objects in ORMs 🤐 But yes.
{{< /callout >}}

## No Interfaces, Abstract Classes or Traits

The DTO defines a data structure, in general it should not extend another
class or implement an interface.

```php
// don't do this
final readonly class SportsterRouteDTO extends DTO {
```

DTOs can be defined entirely via. their constructors:

```php
final readonly class SportsterRouteDTO {
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        /** @var list<array{float,float}> */
        public array $coords,
        public string $createdAt,
    ) {}
}
```

They have no behavior, just structured data. Also **don't use traits** (ever).

## No Value Objects

You should generally not use value objects in DTOs - they are **not** value
objects, nor are they entities. They are structured _carriers of data_.

It follows therefore that a value object cannot be part of a DTO, as then the
DTO would have _behavior_ and would act in ways that are hard to predict. We
_use_ the data in the DTO to populate _richer_ objects.

For example an API returns a date:

```json
{
    // ...
    "date": "2024-12-28T22:28:30+00:00"
}
```

The DTO should _also_ represent this string as a `string` and not, for
example, a `DateTimeImmutable` object. 


```php
final readonly class SportsterActivity {
    public function __construct(
        // ...
        public string $date,
    ) {}
}
```

The **Entity** in your core domain **should definitely use a date value object** but the
the DTOs
only concern is accurately **representing the upstream (or downstream) data
structure**.

## No Property Renaming

As far as is possible the DTO should be a 1-1 representation of the incoming
or outgoing data structure.

```php
// don't do this
class MyDTO {
    // incoming data uses `id` but we want it to be called `$identifier`
    #[SerializedName('id')]
    public int $identifier;
}
```

You can rename `$identifier` to `$id` - not abbreviating `$identifier` might be **your** coding
standard, but it's not **their** coding standard - and more to the point when
comparing the JSON payload to the DTO I'd second guess if I was **looking at the
correct code**. Rename the field.

{{% calloutbl %}}
What if the API is in a foreign language such as American? It would be perfectly understandable
for example to rename `$serialized` to `$serialised` so that people on your
team can work with the code effectively [^effectively].
{{%/ calloutbl %}}

## A Rose by Any Other Name Would Smell as Sweet

There are patterns which involve classes that would pass the DTO test. The Command
pattern is often used to send _commands_ asynchronously over a transport:

```php
final readonly class ImportRemoteRouteCommand {
    public function __construct(public string $vendor, public string $url)
    {
    }
}
```

The command is a DTO - it looks like a DTO and it will be serialized and
deserialized. You can refer to it as a DTO. But is it _useful_ to call
it a DTO? Should we rename it to `ImportRemoteRouteDTO`? Is having the `Command` suffix more _useful_? Perhaps you don't need a suffix at all.

## Summary

DTOs make your life easier by **separating concerns**:

- **Step one**: deserialize the data to a DTO 😁.
- **Step two**: do something with it 🤔.
- **Step three**: profit 💰.

Finally - this blog post is based on my experience. Every project has it's own
needs and many a project has been destroyed by blindly following other
people's opinions and I reserve the right to completely change mine. **Take What you Can Find, Find What You Can Take and Find what Works for YOU and YOUR projects**.

![C-DTO](/images/2024-12-28/cdtolove.png)
*C-DTO Approves 👍*

[^arrayshapes]: you _could_ use [array shapes](https://phpstan.org/writing-php-code/phpdoc-types#array-shapes) to enforce the type with a static analyser but that's more effort than creating a class in this case.
[^entity]: you _should_ feel bad about it, but you may feel using Doctrine attributes is less bad than using
XML or having a separate persistence model.
[^serialize]: the serializer would by default encode the "distance" as a
    JSON object, but Sportster would expect it to be an
    `integer` representing a number of meters.
[^anything]: this is an ideal, of course the domain model depends on the
    programming language itself and other things as may be practical.
[^nobusiness]: Marco disagrees with this point: "We [...] have an Amazon response DTO which then handles squeezing/filtering the relevant bits out of the data before it goes to the biz logic [...] there is some mapping/filtering/aggregation logic that fits DTOs perfectly."
[^anotherway]: there has to be another way as the first way makes no sense at
    all.
[^effectively]: this is a joke (!), but if the API returned fields in German it
    **may** make sense to translate them to English for the benefit of
    maintenance - although at the same time it can make comparing with the raw data
    more difficult.
[^sometimes]: for example if you massive XML document and you need only
    records on a specific path 10 levels deep.
[^beezlebub]: generating DTOs and even entire API clients can make lots of sense. My experience has been that the generated code is mediocre and is only as valid as the spec that was used to generate it. I can spend a few hours making something that's tested against the API, fully type safe and is oriented to the needs of the current project. But your experience may be different.
