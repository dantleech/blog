This year I'm going to fly out to Girona and ultimately make my way west
accross the Pyrenees, it's not the first time I've crossed this mountain
range. I crossed in the opposite direction in 2010 (I made a [website for it
at the time](https://www.dantleech.com/travelblog2010/frontend.php/)). That was
part of my first cycle tour, and I've done a cycle tour almost every year
since.

At this point I've cycled almost every country in Europe and in addition
Morocco and Turkey. I've never _flown to my destination_ and this year I'm
**hopefully** flying out from Bournemouth to Girona with my bike.

## Previous Plans

Cycling the Pyrenees is [what I planned to do last
year]({{< ref "posts/2023/08-03-tour-prep">}}) but it didn't happen due to time
constriants at work (only 2 weeks holiday) and the logistics of getting back
to the UK from Perpignan.

This year I'm trying something different - I'm flying the bike out. Until now
I've never to a _destination_ with my bike instead I've always preferred to
depart from the place I was living at the time, but those opportuntities get
less and less.

## Disc Truckers

I've been pondering this trip for the past 3 months, initially planning to buy
new [Surly Disc Trucker](https://surlybikes.com/bikes/disc_trucker) to replace
my 12 year **old touring bike** which was in a [bad state]({{< ref "posts/2018/07-16-skjeberg-tanumshede" >}}) and has been a bad state
for the past 5 years. Although the old bike _went_ I wasn't entirely confident that it
would _went_ over the Pyrenees.

*Didn't get one of these*

The disk trucker was Â£2,400 from the local bike store and then I wondered if I
should instead get a _different type of bike_ and do a _different type of
tour_ (see [Bikebackping](https://bikepacking.com/)). In the end I thought it
couldn't hurt to take the bike to relatively new [local bike
store](https://www.cambercycleworks.com/) to see what could be done with my
old touring bike and save the "new bike" dilema for another time.

## Repairs

Previous bike engineers looked my poor touring bike with distain, and asked if
I _really wanted to fix it_ and said that it was terminally damaged. Here the
outlook was not so bleak. They said the frame was basically fine,
but the rear wheel was cracked, the rim on the front wheel was dangerously
worn, the gear shifter was broken, the headset needed replacing and a bunch of
other stuff, finally they rebuilt the wheels, replaced what needed replacing,
and it was done in a week and rides better than it has in a 7 years and cost
1/5 of the price of the new bike.

*Taking it out for a test ride*

Having sorted the bike problem, the flight was booked the next day for four
days time and I had lots of shopping to do and a bike box to find.

## Preparations

This year I've got more battery power (including one that can charge the
laptop), I've got a decent **sleeping bag** (not making the mistake of bring one
that was too small, but making the mistake of today buying one that was
physically too big before buying yet another one that wouldn't take up 3/4 of
a panier).

*Power - I'll probably be camping most nights*

The local branch of Halfords were able to provide me with a cardboard bike box, which I had to cut in half in order
to fit it in my mothers small car.

*Will probably tie the two pieces of the box together before putting it on the
plane*

The bike is disassembled and I hope to remember the tools and bits needed to
put it back together in Girona:

## Photos

One of the challenges of the previous bike tours was the labour involved in
copying photos from my phone (which for some reason is not always easy) to my
laptop and then resizing them and referencing them in my blog.

I spent an hour today automating this process
([script](https://gist.github.com/dantleech/222e134c672864617dcb011e98c3b089)),
so that I can now connect the phone with USB and it will preview the new
photos of the day before resizing the ones I choose and putting them in the
blog - hopefully that should mean less stress in the evenings ðŸ˜…. 

## The Plan

The **plan** is to get driven the the Airport, check the boxed-bike in as
over-weight luggage, fly to Girona, land at 16:30, put the bike back together,
**cycle to the train station** (10k away) then **get the train to Barcelona**.

In Barcelona I hope to meet up with some friends at 20:00 (including
ex-colleagues with whom I was working last year before we were made redundant)
before deciding what to do next. Maybe I stay in Barcelona for a day, maybe I
don't. Maybe I miss the plane.
