I'm staying in one of what seems to be the few hostels in the Pyrenees, at
least in Summer - it's also one of the best I've stayed in. The dorm beds are
perfection - absolutely solid and vibration proof and each has thick curtains
to block out the light when somebody decides to turn it on at 4am. There is a
large kitchen and a large common area which is wonderfully decorated and there
are hundreds of books, a bar, table tennis, a guitar, bongos, a didgeridoo, very few
guests and thunder.

*View*

One of the disadvantages is that it's some way from town and there is no
breakfast. I woke at 7:30 and couldn't sleep further, so I got out of bed and
made what breakfast I could - there was free coffee and I had some bread which
I threw in the toaster. I then poured balsamic vinegar on the toast before
realising that it wasn't vegetable oil. I then poured vegetable oil on it then
I took some marmalade from a jar that was in the fridge - which was
technically theft but I'll own it.

After that there was the question of what to do today. The owner had suggested
hitch-hiking to see the biggest water fall in Europe, which is significantly
higher than the Tour-Eiffel. But of course I didn't want to die so I wasn't
going to hitch-hike. Instead I asked about potential trail runs from the
hostel, he directed me to the Lac de Bestampe and questioned my sanity when I
said I wanted to run there. So off I went.

*Trail*

I was a bit worried at what state my legs would be in when I started the
ascent almost immediately after leaving the hostel. It wound up and up. I was
also concerned about water. The run, which was 20k, would take at least 3 hours by my
rekoning (I was told it was an eight hour hike) and it was _hot_.

*Vertigo*

My legs were comfortable and my confidence increased as I rose, and I was
feeling good after an hour and checked my map - not even half way and still
600m vertical to go. I didn't want to back down so I kept going, then I came
accross a mountain stream - water! I cupped a some in my hand and tasted it,
it tasted clear and was cool and refreshing and I tentatively gulpled some
down and took my running shirt off and soaked it and draped it around my neck
then recommenced my pattering up the mountainside.

*Not going to try and cross that*

When I looked about I had a strong feeling of vertigo, it was a long way down,
a _really_ long way so I kept my eyes ahead and focused on not losing my
balance climbing higher and higher and criss crossing the mountain streams
helping myself liberally to the crisp water.

*Out*

Eventually I was confronted with a concrete wall - running horizontally with a
path next to it. I'm sure it contained a pipe. I had been navigating with my
phone and it told me to follow the path along the concrete-covered pipe and
then I encountered water gushing out vertically into the air and down the
mountain side. It wasn't that powerful and I'm sure I could've walked through
it if my life depended on it but at this point in time my life was safer by
not attempting it. So I doubled back the other way and I was blocked by a
lesser gush - easily traversible, but again, I didn't want to die today. I
couldn't climb on to the pipe, but I clambered on a rock and was able _leap_
on top of it. From there I could walk safely up and over the stream to the
footpath... which was more like trodden grass, and, being only in my running
shorts with short socks I again decided that I didn't want to die and turned
back, just 1.5k from the lake.

*Eau*

But I managed 16k and it was good to get some running in after a full week of
cycling.

When I returned I made some coffee and then found the guitar and plucked
around with it for an hour and then laid down in my bed. I was hungry but I
didn't have any food so I just lay in bed and drifted in and out of
conciousness until a new guy joined the dorm  (which at that point was
occupied by me only) he was Belgian and was doing a part of the GR10 hiking
trail and had walked for 6 hours.

It was now 16:00 and I was hungry and I had no food and I had a weeks worth of
dirty underwear to take care of and town was a 30 minutes walk away and I was
feeling restless and bored.

I decided to use the €3 laundry service to wash my underwear and threw in my
cycling and running clothes too. I then had to wait for an hour, feeling bored
and depressed - I'm happy in the act of _travelling_ alone, but when
stationary the time is better spent in company and I had none.

Twiddled on the guitar did I for another hour then laundry collected put on
line but clouds were over and damp in the air and it wasn't going to dry
before nightfall so back to reception and to the tumble dryer it went for
another €3 and went into town for pizza did I.

"Est-ce le pizza p____e c'est vegeterrien?"
"Oui!"
"Bien, une comme ca, et une bier"
"La quelle"
"Bier vegeterian" said one of the cooks and I laughed igoring the fact that
the beers may not in-fact be vegetarian.
"Bier blonde"

Sat down outside in the market on the tables the only one there awkwardly
sitting in my Hawaiian shirt looking at my phone and trying not to look at my
phone. It was too crowded to get the laptop out. Would look too strange. Pizza
had olives, didn't eat those feeling somewhat lost but fed.

Walked back to the hostel collected my dry washing and had a nice chat with
the owner who was playing table tennis with his son. I complemented him on the
beds and the curtains "I spent so long on those" he said "I had to sew each
one" the hostel is clearly a labour of love.
