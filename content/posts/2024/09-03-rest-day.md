The dorm room was air conditioned but my nose was looking out for the smell of
my sandals. I had thought that they would be impervious to that sickly smell
that comes to inhabit sandals that are sweated into every day of the week, but
I was wrong and I will need to clean them at some point. Despite having a
large traffic in pilgrims there are no facilities for drying clothes or airing
hiking boots. Otherwise the hostel is good, clean and the beds are as good as
the ones at the last hostel.

I'm at the outside bar as with yesterday night, the difference being that we
all all sheltered under an awning as although the rain has stopped momentarily
it has been raining quite consistently which has caused lots of people to
question their next moves and the prospects for the next week do not look
particularly good - but also the weather forecasts change from hour to hour
here.

I've chatted with lots of people today. The american purchased a bike from
Decathlon and plans to sell it back when he's done reclaiming 50% of the value. He plans
to cycle across the Pyrenees but hasn't made any significant plans, and is still deciding
if he needs to buy a sleeping bag or a tent or where or how he is going to
stay. The German lady is walking the Camino and finding it tough, the
Austrlian was a just-retired sports teacher who had rented an electric bike to
do 50k of the camino every day - 850k in total. The Dutch lady was writing a
blog post about her Camino on her phone and had also found it hard, muddy, work in the
first few days but was pleased with the photos she had taken on the trail.

There are lots of English tourists in San Sebastian which contrasts sharply
my count of zero fellow English encountered crossing the Pyrenees.

*Wet Island*

There is lots of rain in San Sebastian and I started the day waiting for the
rain to die down to a dribble before asking the staff where I could get
breakfast and making a two-block run to it where I was happy to get my
Tostada, Zumas, Cafe and the Spanish equivalent of the pain-au-chocolate for
€7.00. Things seem cheaper in Spain, the 500ml draft beer I'm drinking cost
€3.50.

*What Jesus sees*

The only activity I could contemplate today was a run. After checking some
routes on Strava I disregarded them and decided to run up and down the
seafront and then to Jesus.

San Sebastian is being blessed continuously by a giant Jesus on the top of a
hill called [Urgull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urgull) and on reflection
it was an easy destination for a run, although somewhat too short hence the
run up and down the sea front first.

*Pointing*

The only issue was the rain, which would not stop. This wouldn't be an issue
normally, I love running in the rain but I don't like wet clothes when I'm
travelling, I don't want to pack wet trainers in my bag and have them stink the
bag out. But the day was ticking on and I decided to embrace the damp,
possibly at the expense of everybody else in the dorm, but running comes
first.

*View from the Jesus battlements*

Jesus was accessed by a large number of steps and a steep hairpin footpath.
At the top he was situated on a foritified castle, with a large number of
rusting canon on display and with the towering Jesus statue in the middle of
them all as if He were in fact the primary defensive weapon against the
English and Portuguese.

*Christ*

My legs felt better than expected and I was able to run at a reasonable pace
although below this year's running peak around three months ago.

I spent a lot of time in bed today, trying to plan a project in my head but
not finding any catalysing thoughts. I also checked in with my client and did
an hours work and did a few spasms of work on my open-source project.

*On the beach*

What am I going to do tomorrow? The weather report has improved (although it
may well have changed completely in the mean-time). I _could_ cycle to Bilbao
tomorrow. It is a long day - at least 115k - and more depending on the route.
Bilbao is served by a motorway and a national route. The motorway is a toll
road so I can perhaps expect the national route to be busy and it can either
have a hard-shoulder or not. Then it is possible to avoid the national route
by taking "minor" roads, country roads, which will be longer and slower.

The alternative is to get the train. In either case I would stay in Bilbao for
the night and there is an overnight ferry to Portsmouth on the 5th from where
I would be able to get the train back to my hometown.

Yet another alternative is to cycle home across France and get the ferry from
Roscoff or perhaps from Saint-Malo or any of the other french ports. It would
be somewhat of an anti-climax after the Pyrenees however.
