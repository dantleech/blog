My eyes are heavy and although I've just sat down at **17:39** to write something
in the hostel's common room I'm considering retiring to bed for a power nap.

ðŸ˜´ðŸ˜´ðŸ˜´ðŸ˜´ðŸ˜´ðŸ˜´


**18:30** - Power nap achieved.  I'm now sitting in the hotel's courtyard on a
table having bought a beer. It's a large hostel and I'm staying in a mixed
dorm. I've counted 3 other cyclists including a couple on a tandem. I'm in
Spain, in San Sebastian, having not found any accommodation in Hendaye, but it
was a good choice as it brought my kilometers up to 100k. The weather is
clouded over but it doesn't look like it will rain, I'm now clean and am
feeling a little bit sun-blasted. There are little birds jumping about on the
floor.

This morning I was in Saint-Jean Port-de-Pied. I woke at 7 and started packing
out. Shortly after when emerging from my tent I was greeted by the dutch guy
and then the Spanish pilgrim emerged from his tent thanking the Dutch guy for
what he did yesterday (I don't know what). He had been ill for the past days
due to bad weather on the Camino but reported that he was better now. When I
mentioned the deal whereby I paid for the pitch and he would give me
half of the money (â‚¬6.60) he strained his eyes and looked confused I had
already decided that I'd not _ask_ for the money but wanted him to know the
"arrangement". I think the Dutch guy may have paid for his previous night. He
was a Spaniard from Barcelona and had strongly defined muscles on his legs.

I said "adios!" and hopped on my bike (after filling it with water and using
the toilet) and my primary mission was to find breakfast. I wanted a "formule"
including a baguette with butter and jam, a crosissant, an orange juice and a
coffee. There were a few different restaurants. "Petite-dejeuner?" "Oui" the
barman looked at me. It was a positive response but he expected something more
from me. After a silence he nodded towards a pile of croissants. They had no
"formule" but I recited "pain chocolat", "baguette avec du beur", "jus
d'orange" et "cafe au lait". As I retreated to an outside seat by my bicycle I
worried how much it would cost me - when I got the bill it was â‚¬11 in total
which is better than I feared but far from the â‚¬7.50 I had hoped.

*After Breakfast*

The town was an interesting one, a walled one. One with gates and towers and
steep medieval high-streets. From the town's perspective I disappeared into
the mist.

*Mist*

I was surprised that the first 20k of the day were mostly on descent, so
within a few hours I had already covered a significant number of kilometers
listening mainly to Fleetwood Mac and David Bowie. I was concerened about the
weather but at a certain point I saw the mist brighten and patches of blue and
finally the mist departed and the only sun remained.

*Clearing mist*

During the descent I noticed that I had to pull my levers much further to
brake than when I had started and I tightened them on the headset. 7 days of
mountains will wear your brakes down.

*Last col*

I was feeling tired and although I had a great headstart due to the unexpected
descent I was impatient to reach the coast. The terrain was undulating and I
made the final col: Col de Saint Ignace - which was a child-like
169m compared with the monstrous 2,115m of the Tourmalet.

*The Sea*

I finally reached the coast and then saw signs for a cycle route to Hendaye, so I
blindly followed it. **Big mistake!!**. I was ready to cruise around the coast but
the cycle path went inland and took me up a hill steeper than any on the
Tourmalet "thanks guys" I said aloud "take the cycle path they said" "it will
be a good idea they said". I looked at my map at the main road hugging the
coast while I slogged and sweated up the pernicious slope which led to a
garbage dump. Finally descended into Hendaye and followed my GPX track to it's
end - and it was done.

![OpenCamera/IMG_20240902_141945.jpg](/images/spain2024/202409011845-9hendaye.jpg)
*Hendaye*

The accommodation in Hendaye was expensive, there was an option of staying in a
"camping" hostel for â‚¬25 - while that was somewhat appealing I wanted to take
a rest day and put my bike in a building and not leave it in a field. I looked
further afield, there were some pensions for â‚¬70 outside of the town, or I
could cycle over the border and stay in a hostel in San Sebastian.

*End of the GPX track here*

The only problem was that I was exhausted and had already exherted more effort
than I anticpated due to the wonderous cycle route. My bum ached. This wasn't a
special cicumstance, my bum has ached continuously. The cream saved me from
_pain_ but it never stopped the ache. I guessed it could take another 20k
today and make my 100k target. Well done bum.

*Hendaye beach*

I rode down the Hendaye beach before approaching the precarious mess of roads
leading over the border to Spain. I used my GPX to plot a course, and it
immediately led me on a "avoid the main road" course which was inevitably a
hillier way of joining the main road eventually. The road wasn't a nice one.

I passed Hendaye train station which brought back memories from a decade ago
when I had cycled this route with my father from Biaritz. The weather had been
terrible and we cycled to Hendaye in a snow storm and were glad to get the
train and skip the part of the journey which I was now embarking on.

As I crossed into Spain I remembered to put my helmet on (I didn't want to get
busted by the cops) and reflected that I couldn't take refuge in music by
putting my headphones in (but I also considered that I could probably get away
with having one in my right ear).

As I progressed down the hard shoulder of a dual-carriadgeway and 100 ton
lorries charged passed me I saw a cycle sign "San Sebastian 11k" with an
arrow. I followed it expecting to be put onto a quiet path or road, but
instead it took me onto another hard shoulder and it didn't feel like the
safest road to ride on.

Finally I approached San Sebastian and was on city cycle paths passing
the active industrial port and some old buildings that looked to be in a bad
state of repair. To my right was the train line and the river and I remembered
staying in some kind of accomodation on the other side of this river many years ago.

*Port*

I booked the hostel earlier in the day so I found it and checked in without
any stress I've booked it for two nights. Tomorrow I will consider what to do
next. Getting the boat back to the UK from Bilbao is an option and it's a days
ride from here.
