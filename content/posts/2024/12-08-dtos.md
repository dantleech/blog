In my previous post I talked about [Value
Objects]({{< ref "11-24-php-value-objects-and-you" >}}) in this post I will
talk about DTOs - data transfer objects - from my perspective.

What is a DTO?
--------------

DTO is a class that is intended to be created _from_ an unstructured form and/or a class that
can be converted _to_ the same unstructured form. **DTOs are typically used to give structure to
the input and output of your application** and incidentally enable you to
decouple the input and output from your business model.

In PHP the unstructured form is typically an `array`. Below we use an imaginary service with the role of _mapper_ to **safely** map an array to the
DTO and back again:

```php
// this is a DTO
class StravaActivityDTO {
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        public string $date,
        public float $distance,
        public float $time
        public ?float $averageHeartRate
    ) {}
}

// imagine we got this array by decoding the JSON response from the Strava API
$array = [
    'title' => 'Run along the Esplanade',
    'date' => '2018-02-20T18:02:13Z',
    'distance' => 10000,
    'time' => 2700,
];

$dto = Mapper::create()->fromArray(StravaActivityDTO::class, $array);
var_dump($dto->title); // prints "Run along the Esplanade"

$newArray = $mapper->toArray($dto);
var_dump($newArray == $array); // prints "true". we converted the DTO back to the original form.
```

The following statements are always true:

- DTOs are always intended to be **serialized** and/or **deserialized**.
- DTOs do not have **business** logic.

And I would consider the following statements to be virtuous:

- DTOs are read-only and final.
- DTOs only have public properties.
- DTOs have no getters or setters.
- DTOs only contain primitive types or other DTOs.
- DTOs are **not** responsible for their own serialization and
  deserialization.
- DTOs do not penetrate beyond the frontiers of your application.
