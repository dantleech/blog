This morning I didn't rush to leave the campsite, but sat and made two pots of
coffee while sitting and reading Moby Dick, leaving after 9:30.

This a bit late, as I knew that the next ferry would leave at 10:00, leaving
me little time to make it to the ferry port. As I was cycling I calculated
that I would miss the ferry, but then finally rolled into Talbert at 9:55 and
realised it wasn't too late, so I cycled as fast as possible, until I saw the
ferry - which was just unloading cars, I arrived with a few minutes to
spare.

_Ferry from Tarbert_

A woman came around collecting the fee "we only take card" she said, so I gave
her mine "have you got another one?" "err, no" she then muttered something
about online payments and I offered my German card, stating that if my English
one didn't work, there's little chance my German one would. "I'll pretend that
that worked then" said she and left me ticket-less.

The next very hilly 50k would lead me to the next ferry at Dunoon. I suffered
somewhat as lunchtime came and went and I couldn't find anywhere to stop.
Ideally I needed a bench, but even a tree stump would have done, but for 10s
of kilometers there was only grass and gravel.

Before Dunoon there was the town of Sandbank and the Holy Loch Marina, which
during the cold war was base to America's nuclear submarines.

The second ferry was more successful in collecting my money and I landed at
McInroys point about 2k west of Gourock, which was more than 30 miles from
Glasgow.

Eaglesham was my destination today, which while in Glasgow is at the southern
most limit and around 10 kilometers to the south. But the cycle path me most
of the way.

The first thing I noticed as I approached Glasgow was a huge hill "I didn't
expect that" I thought. As I approached it I started to climb, until I reached
the top, then the cycle path ran over an old railway line, which ran slightly
downhill for about 10 or more miles.

People seemed a little less friendly the closer I got to Glasgow as the
demographic changed from people enjoying the country to people going about
their local business and my nods and "hellos" were reciprocated less, with one
woman offering a Glaswegian "an' you can fuck off", but others were more
friendly "nice bike pal!"

As I rode towards Eaglesham my phone died "no problem" i thought, I'll just
charge it up with my batter pack, but unfortunately this was also unexpectedly
empty - I used it to charge my tablet earlier and it seems that the tablet
requires much more juice than my phone and it had taken fully the remaining
power. Fortunately I could still use my laptop as a backup power source.

I was welcomed by my friend and his girlfriend and we had more than a few
beers and now it's the day after and I'm sitting here at 8am with a slightly
woozy head.

Today would be the final stretch of my "tour", I'll cycle maybe 100k to my
brothers place and stay there for some days. Probably flying back to Berlin
with or without the bicycle.
