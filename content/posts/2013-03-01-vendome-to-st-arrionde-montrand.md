From Dads journal: Ibis eat all you like breakfast always great value at 6 euros! Left hotel at 9 20 am making good progress to St Florent for espresso coffee stop (Dad converted by Dan especially as it’s cheap). The sun shone so removed rain-top for first time when cycling. Arrived in St Arrionde Montrand where Dan bought compression socks at 40 euros to help ease and perhaps overcome injury. Misunderstanding with hotel owner over double bed in room instead of singles. Transfer to a room with double and single bed then told it would be 20 euros extra, finally resolved by returning to original room and Dan sleeping on floor in sleeping bag. Also annoyance at being charged for putting bikes in garage but fee waived when agreeing to pay for breakfast which turned out to be remarkably good. 65 miles.
