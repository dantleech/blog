Robb left in car for Paris with Danâ€™s friends at 6am, thus enabling several hours leisure time in city before Eurostar boarding. Dan and I ate a good breakfast and set out at 9am travelling through Volvic on a hilly route stopping for coffee at Rochefort where much snow had fallen. Onwards to snow-bound Ussal and three star hotel by railway station with supermarket nearby enabling top up with provisions. The owner spoke very good English and the night was comfortable. 59 (challenging) miles.
