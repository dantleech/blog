A lazy morning. Muesli in bed and Dan arrived with croissants from the bakery. As the sun shone we went to Museum of Contemporary Arts featuring a display of carrier bags, rubble in woks and a large mural by Gilbert and George. In nearby park I removed my shirt for brief time as we revelled in the sunshine. Debbie cooked a meal and we had drinks outside Place de la Victorie, again very pleasant evening.
