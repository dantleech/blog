Rained heavily in night and left hotel at 8 40 am on a day of intermittent sleet and heavy rain showers on a mountainous route to Ondarroa via Lekei then inland to Gernika and eventually into a bustling Bilbao. Hotel found with difficulty and told by owner that bikes cost 10 euros to be garaged, and no eating allowed in rooms! Our room however had nice view of river. We dined out in restaurant area of bar populated by elderly people playing cards. A lovely pasta based meal prepared by a friendly female cook with beers and total of cost just 30 euros for both. 57 miles
