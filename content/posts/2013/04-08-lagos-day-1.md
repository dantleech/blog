Apparently trip advisor ranked this place no. 1 in a poll of "15 up-and-coming destinations". I spoke to a guy in the Hostel in Lisbon who said that, paraphrasing, this place was being colonized by the English.

- Its full.. of people .. of your people .. people like you!

This is the south coast of Portugal.

I rode into town and was surprised to pass an bookshop selling English books, I made a note to return to it the following day, thinking that I would be leaving the following day and I could call in on my way out.

I checked out the Hostel, inquired as to the price, €12. Inquired as to the security, no problems and to the noise level.

- Everybody has to be quiet after midnight, and there is a security guard here at night.

So far so good.

I was still without my bank card, and was expecting it to arrive at my fathers address in England. I was anxious as it should have arrived with him by now, but not too anxious as I still had about 2 weeks of money left.

Spent €16.63
