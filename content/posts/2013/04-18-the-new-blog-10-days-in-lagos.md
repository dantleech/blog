Last tuesday I phoned my friend Franck in Paris

- "Hey Franck, hows it going?"
- "Yeah, pretty good mate."
- <smalltalk>
- "All my stuff nicked, I need to ask you a favour"
- "Sure"
- "Can you pick up my credit card from the bank, and send it over here."
- "No problem"

Thought it would arrive maybe the next day, maybe the day after.

I am staying in a Youth Hostel in Lagos, its a pretty good deal. They have a good breakfast and its the quiet season so I have a 4 bed dormitory all to myself. There are only about 5 people staying here, and theres a capacity for about 60.

But fortunately this has given me lots of time to work on my overdue website, and this is it. It doesn't look like much now, but I will be not only adding journal entries and photos, but also features to the site.

Anyway, the weather is hot and I have been hacking away at this computer since 9:00 this morning, so I'm going for a run.
