From Dads journal: Left hotel in mist and frost 9 30 am, arriving at Montlucon 32 miles later at 12 30 pm. With Dan increasingly worried by injury we booked in early at Hotel De L ‘Universe intending to take train to rendezvous venue next day. I managed to fall from bike when parking in hotel grounds. Although I was shaken the only injury was a bruised chest caused by striking stay on the handlebar. Owner spoke fluent English and facilities included a gym and sauna which I (but not Dan) blissfully took advantage of! We walked into town and visited the mediaeval chateau. Dan cooked a lentil supper on his gas stove and we watched the film Django on his laptop. Violent but not mindlessly and quite watchable.
