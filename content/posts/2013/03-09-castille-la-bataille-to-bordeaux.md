From Dads journal: Leisurely cycle ride to Bordeaux along quiet roads with stop for coffee in bright sunshine at Branne. Reached hotel (with cooking facilities in room) at 1 30 pm but room not ready and hassle parking bikes. Debbie arrived at 4pm and in the balmy evening the three of us strolled into town and in relaxed mode drank lager outside a bar, then an excellent meal in Italian restaurant. 32 miles.
