From Dads journal: Another day with Dan delivering croissants at breakfast time. I cycled to the riverside and ran 4 miles on grassland then cycled along long promenade again in warm sunshine. We visited Musee Des Beaux Arts which was very disappointing but coffee outside in the cathedral square was lovely. With the temperature just about warm enough Debbie and I had evening meal in evening in venue near quayside.
