From Dads journal: It was raining when leaving the hotel at 8 40 am. Dan bought a few items at giant sports shop on city outskirts. Coffee and croissant at Terrasson la Villedieu. I was annoyed seeing Fois Gras factories with pictures of smiling ducks displayed at entry gates. Into Perigueux and Ibis budget hotel from 2pm approximately. I walked into town and spent time inside huge cathedral, then got lost and jogged the streets until I recognised surroundings! Watched dourly intriguing film on laptop called Children of Men. 47 miles.
