From Dads journal: Accompanied Debbie to tram for trip to airport at 8 30 am. Dan and I left hotel at 9 30 am making gradual progress towards coast out of Bordeaux in wind and rain. We had coffee near Facture and lunch at Parentis en Born, then on to Mimizan where we booked into hotel for 58 euros and dried our wet clothing on the bathroom radiator. Yet another dining-in night involving baguettes! I had night sweats but seemingly okay by morning. Discovered that Debbieâ€™s aeroplane landing at Gatwick was briefly delayed by snow on runway. 62 miles.
