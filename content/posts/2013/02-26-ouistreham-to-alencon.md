From Dads journal: Awake 6am local time and had cooked breakfast. First stop Falaise for coffee and cake. Through Argenan to hotel at Alencon via mountainous region with snow falling. Basic one star hotel, noisy but warm. Devoured baguettes in room washed down with cheapish red wine (a version of a meal repeated many times on trip). Able to contact Debbie most evenings with Dan’s phone (contract enabling free overseas calls). Also regular e-mail contact with Jenny. Very sore bottom after another long ride of 74 miles.
