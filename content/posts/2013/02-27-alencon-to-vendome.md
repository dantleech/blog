Typical French breakfast, ¼ baguette plus croissant with butter and jam. Weather cold but dry. Slowish progress over hilly terrain.  Another long day with one coffee stop via la Ferte Barnard St Calais to isolated hotel at 6pm on outskirts of Vendome -a spacious apartment with cooking facilities. Dan cooked a pleasant pasta-based meal and very relaxed. 67 miles.
