After a leisurely morning including another sauna experience we boarded train to Riom at 12 21pm and reached Ibis budget hotel early afternoon. Dan collected Robbie by train from Clemont Ferrand and returned at 6pm. Danâ€™s workmates (Frank, Eric, Jordan and ?) from Paris arrived at same time. I bought extra provisions at supermarket for a ravenous Robb.
