This is this months _effort_ at recording a song. I tried to record a song
about the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) on Saturday, but it
didn't succeed, so I decided to record a cover of a song I've been listening
to on repeat for the past 3 weeks.

I'm not very happy with it, in particular I'm not happy with my voice - I'm
incapable of singing, especially in this vocal range 😅. I am singing
weakly at the top of my range, and there are some notes which I simply cannot
reach. I tried to improve them by double (and triple) tracking.

I feel sorry for my neighbours listening to me singing at the top of my voice
for more than a few hours.

Still, it was an interesting exercise. To begin with I tried to be faithful
with the drums, but when I realised how long the song was I started to copy
and paste more, by the end of the song I had largely given up. As usual for
the guitar solo I started with good intentions, reproducing the first few
bars, but then decided it was too much work and just played random notes.

Recording the song made me appreciate the song structure and the drumming
more.
