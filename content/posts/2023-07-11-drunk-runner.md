Yesterday I booted up a laptop from 13 years ago, and it's a treasure trove of
personal memories which covered an important transitional moment in my life.

*my 2010 laptop*

Over 13 years ago I was overweight, I couldn't see my own winkie and I had to
lie on my side when I slept. I ate because I was depressed, and I thought I
was depressed because I was overweight, then I drank - I drank to escape.

One day on the eve of the New Year of 2019 I drank myself stupid and
listened loundly to Beethovens 5th at four in the morning and decided that I
had had enough. I wrote a drunken email to my parents to say that I would
start running the next day. I sent lots of drunken emails at this time, and
most of them I would regret, but this was one of two drunken emails that I
absolutely didn't regret (the other was resigning from my job somewhat later
that year).

> I was and had never been an sports person, nor did I ever plan to become one.

It sounds easy, a trivial decision! Just start running! But it was not
trivial, it was my last chance. I decided to run _twice_ a day - once in the
morning and once in the evening and I started on New Years Day 2010.

The only way I can describe the depression is this feeling was being
underwater - I was always underwater. It's impossible for me now to imagine
the state of mind that I had back then. I am, miraculously, better. Not
"perfect" but better - I am not underwater now, and I never thought that that
would have been possible

I decided to run twice a day and I decided that I would do it regardless of
how I felt about it. I would pace up and down my dirty appartment trying to
find excuses not to run and in the end I learnt a trick - I would go running
in spite of myself ignoring my mind's narative - "you can't go
outside, people will laugh at you - you look ridiculous! you fat fuck!" - I
closed my ears to this narative and like a robot opened the door and left.

The first day I ran for just 13 minutes, this was the hardest day, the next
day I ran in the morning, then in the evening. For about one month I did this
and the change was dramatic. Within a month or two I lost a huge amount of weight.

*I rediscovered the training app I made to track my runs*

I ate and drank the same amount as I had before - but then - as I ran longer
distances I noticed something: I felt drunk - but without being drunk - without
drinking I had the "clarity" of mind that I sought in drink. The feeling of
_not drowning_.

As drowining was my default state, being able to not drown while **not** drinking a
bottle of Jack Daniels was a revelation! I didn't realise that you could have
this feeling without alcohol and I started to drink less as I started to run
longer.

After the first month I was comparitively fit! In March 2010 - three months
after I started to run I ran the Bath Half Marathon in 1 hour 47 minutes at a
pace of 08:09 a mile - in September that same year I ran the Bristol Half
Marathon in 1 hour 38 minutes at a pace of 07:28.

It was about this time that I decided to quit my job and cycle around France
and one day I woke up in an tiny appartment in Paris and wondered "what the
fuck am I doing here?" it was surreal. I was working and living in Paris. At
the beginning of that year I couldn't see my winkie and had problems climbing
stairs or leaving my flat, now I was living in Paris.

2010 was an interesting year.
