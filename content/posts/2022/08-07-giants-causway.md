Currently sitting in a hostel in dinning room in Bushmills eating
chips-cheese-and-beans[1]. I just had a conversation with an Australian who is
riding around the coast on a Brompton bike. I'm drinking a ginger beer and
it's been an interesting 24 hours.

Last night the campsite was very noisy, there were 6 year old kids running
about everywhere and a group of 14 year olds having a small party in the next
field (not part of the campsite) blaring house music through a portable
speaker. I decided to go for a walk, when I came back I decided to fix my
cycle computer.

I spent 10 minutes running the wheel backwards and forwards past the magnet,
changing the position of the spoke magnet each time to no effect - no signal
was getting through to the "computer". Then I saw a stray wire - the wire
connecting my computer to the receiver was severed. Using my fingernails (I
couldn't find the knife) I pulled the insulation off the wires and twisted
them together before wrapping the bound wires in gorilla tape. My cycle
computer is working again now.

*Before and after: fixed with fingernails and good intentions*

The blaring-music kids in the next field seemed to have developed an animosity
with the 6 year olds as a girl started shouting the most revolting abuse at a
six year old boy "you fat f--k, you c--k sucker, how old are you? suck my ass"
and so on, and it just went on and on. She was clearly enjoying channeling her
hate at this 6 year old kid and his friends. 

My neighbor went over to ask them if they could keep it down "Sir, are they
your kids?" "No they are not, but I don't want my kids listening to that
language" "I'm sorry Sir, but " and then she tried to justify it before
deciding to redirect her anger at this burly [Full Iron
Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_Triathlon) participant "you c--k
sucker, you dirty old man, why don't you suck a dick" and so on (they were
doubtless emboldened by the large fence between them). Perhaps
sensing that they had gone too far they then left and did not return. 

After this episode there were only the kids running about playing games until
11PM and then two scottish blokes drinking, laughing and belching until 1AM. I
n the absence of ear plugs I resorted to listening to [music for
programming](https://musicforprogramming.net/) for 2 hours before it was
quiet enough to sleep, and I slept well, waking up at 8 and, after a quick
shower, was on the road at 9AM.

My destination was Port Rush, which by an optimistic calculation was 100k
away. I headed north and stopped at a Spar to get a coffee. I sat on a bench
outside and a squad of road-cyclists arrived. They struck up a conversation
I said I was heading to Torr Head, they told me to not go to Torr Head.

My Iron-Man neighbor from the previous night told me to avoid Tor Head and I
probably would have avoided it in ignorance, but when somebody tells me not to
go somewhere because it's "too steep" then I will go there.

I decided to listen to some music, unfortunately I realised I had no music and
I didn't want to stream music on Spotify (to save bandwidth ha ha ha ha more
on this later) but I did have Megadeth (Youthanasia) downloaded. I listened to
that for an hour and stopped for lunch. I decided to transfer some music from
my laptop.

*Bike on the beach*

I used an application called [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) to transfer
the music from my computer to my phone, I believed that it would transfer the
music directly from my laptop to my phone via. the Wifi tethering, I assumed
the laptop would be on the same network as my phone so transferring via. the
internet would not be necessary. I was transferring 10GB of music, and after
2GB the transfer rate tanked. And I thought "oh shit I've just transferred 2GB
over the internet and burnt all my data roaming allowance". It seems I still
have around 4GB of 6GB left, so ðŸ¤· maybe it's fine.

After following the coast road to Cushendun I started the first of 3 or 4 very
steep climbs in undulating terrain. As I started I realised that I couldn't
change to my largest gear on the rear sprocket, I stopped and increased the
tension on the gear cable. Without that high gear there is no way I could
manage a 33% (so one of the cyclists said) climb. At some points going at
3kmph and twisting from one side of the road to the other. It was hard work
and the climb peaked at around 320m before basically descending 3 or so miles
to Ballycastle. My legs were struggling and sore, but I pulled through.

*The road was already quite steep at this point* 

The Tor road was a small, minor, road and I was relieved when I saw the A road
up ahead. as I crossed the junction a police 4x4 came round the corner and
surprised me, it stopped directly in front of me as I was half way across the
road - so that my bike was in the middle of the road with it's tail in the
path of potential traffic. The policeman wound down the window and I cycled
towards the back of the van to get clear of the other side of the road before
he started lecturing me.

"Where's your helmet?" "You've got no high-vis jacket" and he scrutinized my
bike evidently looking to chastise me if I had no lights. "Is it a
legal requirement to wear a helmet in Ireland?" "It may well be a legal requirement but
it's not safe to not have a helmet, we've had fatalities on this road, on this
corner" "have you got a helmet" "no I have not" and he went on like this for
some time while I was stranded in the middle of the road on a blind corner
with his 4x4 blocking the traffic. He seemed like a bit of a c--t. He was very
passive aggressive throughout "take care yeah" "yeah, thank you so much mate, you've
been a great help". It's not a legal requirement to wear a helmet and I'm
pretty sure the only irresponsible behavior was them stopping me half-way
across the road. Of course for the next hour I involuntarily replayed the
situation and all the different ways I could have handled it.

![Towards Ballycastle](/images/ireland2022/2022-08-07_north.jpg) 
*Looking towards the Giants Causeway* 

At Ballycastle there was lots of traffic and tourists. I stopped at a Spar and
got myself an energy drink and some jam tarts. I sat outside near the beach
with people passing. I looked at places to stay tonight, in Portrush the
campsites looked like they may be as bad as the one last night, there was
another campsite about 10k before Portrush which looked better. I decided to
search for a hostel on my map and saw "Giants Causeway Hostel".

I had no idea I would be passing the [Giants
Causeway](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giants_Causeway) today. In this case
it made perfect sense to stay at a hostel, leaving my stuff secure while I
visit. It would also be a perfectly acceptable reason to violate the 100k per
day rule.

As I was leaving girl stopped and asked me where I was going, she was very
enthusiastic and said she walked the Wild Atlantic Way in 29 days.

Listening to music though a single earphone (yay Bluetooth and not having a headphone
jack) and proceeding with cloudy weather I got to the "Giant Causeway Hostel",
which was probably about a 15 minute walk from the Giants Causeway. I
suspected they would be full, and they were (except for a private room for Â£65
but I'm not paying that if I can avoid it). The Spanish girl at reception
phoned the main hostel in Bushmills and they did have a bed in a dormitory for
Â£15.

It was a bit further than I hoped, and I checked in, had a shower and decided
to walk to the Causeway. The receptionist said it was about an hours walk.
Unfortunately I didn't make it far. My ankle deteriorated quickly and I had
made barely 100m before I went through the stages of "I'll be fine", "I'll
probably make it", "this really hurts", then finally accepting that there was
no possible way I could walk 10 kilometers. I turned back and my ankle became
very problematic and I had to walk very slowly to the off license to get a
couple of beers. 

I've decided to either run it or walk it tomorrow morning, as my ankle should be
able to handle it then (fingers crossed).

**[1]** I don't particularly _like_ CC&B, or at least I don't like them now. I
used to like them when I was a teenager, usually at 3AM at Scoffers in
Weymouth town center. I try to like them each time I return to the UK.
