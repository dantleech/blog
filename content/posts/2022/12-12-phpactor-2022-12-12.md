I have tagged [Phpactor 2022.12.12](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/releases/tag/2022.12.12).

This is the 4th monthly Phpactor release, I forgot (or rather conveniently
forgot) to write a blog post for the previous [release
2022.11.12](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/releases/tag/2022.11.12) so
I'll include the best changes from that too in this update.

The most significant change with this "tag" is that we no longer support [PHP
7.4](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/issues/1956). If this causes you
issues please add a comment on [this ticket](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/issues/1956).

Features
--------

### Replace Qualifier with Import (2022.11.12)

This another contribution from [@mamazu](https://github.com/mamazu). This
refactoring will allow you (in LSP) to replace a fully qualified name with an
import. For example invoking code actions on `new \Foobar\Barfoo\Bazboo` will
give you an option to import `use Foobar\Barfoo\Bazboo` and have `new Bazboo`.

### Symfony Extension (2022.11.12)

The new built-in Symfony extension will facilitate any kind of integration
with the Symfony framework, for now it is providing completion for the
container:

It is able to infer the types from the container and provide completion on the
service within the container when it's used as a service locator.

### Prophecy Extension (2022.11.12)

Another advance in Phpactor's internals has enabled the Prophecy extension:

### Generate Mutator

This is code action was introduced by
[@florian-merle](https://github.com/florian-merle) and allows you to generate
"mutators" (a.k.a. setters) in the same way that you can currently generate
accessors (a.k.a. getters).

Context
-------

Most of the contributions in the past month have been from external
contributors, which is great! I have personally been turning my eye to another
[side project](https://github.com/dantleech/pttlog) which has taken much of
the time and energy I would otherwise use for Phpactor (and due to which I am
able to tell you that I have spent "just" 15 hours on Phpactor since it's
inception). But I'm hoping to get back into it in the new year ðŸ˜¼
