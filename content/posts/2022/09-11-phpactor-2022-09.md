*Phpactor 2022.09.11*

Today I have
[tagged](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/releases/tag/2022.09.11)
Phpactor `2022.09.11`. The previous release was [Phpactor
18](/blog/2022/01/03/phpactor-18) all the way back in January.

It has been a significant 8 months for Phpactor:

- Conversion to a [mono-repository](/blog/2022/03/06/phpactor-is-a-monolith).
- Completely refactored [type system](/blog/2022/04/17/phpactors-new-type-system).
- Phpactor [theme song](/blog/2022/03/29/phpactor-theme-song).
- _Numerous_ features and improvements (see [highlights](#highlights))

Converting Phpactor to a monorepo has accelerated development _significantly_,
it has been far easier to fix bugs and add features. It is imaginable to say
that more progress has been made in these 8 months than in the past 3 years
and it's still awful.

### CalVer

I've decided to use
[CalVer](https://twitter.com/dantleech/status/1569046484959592448) (i.e.
tagging releases as `YYYY.MM.DD`) from now
on. Previously Phpactor has been stuck in the long hell of `0.x` releases,
which begs the question: what would `1.0.0` look like? Semantic versioning
doesn't make any sense here, Phpactor is not a library, and since it is now a
monorepo, it also does not offer extension points which plugins would depend
on, and if it did, the API can be offered as a separate, semantically versioned,
package.

> Tagging Phpactor is, for me, a symbolic act - development is continouous. Some people
> were still using the `0.18` version. From now on I'll try and tag a new
> version each month for the benefit of the changelog, people that require
> tagged versions and to give me something to blog about.

### Removal of the extension manager

I made a big thing of [Phpactor
Extensions](/blog/2018/11/25/phpactor-extensions). The dream was you could
start with only the extension manager package, and build your own Phpactor. In
practice I created a monster that was tightly coupled to the internals of
Composer 1.

As Composer 1 became more deprecated I was faced with the looming spectre of
having to rewrite the extension manager from scratch. I didn't have the time.
In addition, having the monorepo meant that extensions would have to depend on
the _entire monorepo_ package for testing (no I have not yet, and probably
never will, setup a repo split).

Finally I opted to simply remove the extension manager and bundle the
extensions into Phpactor by default, they are just "available" to be activated
with a [config
switch](https://phpactor.readthedocs.io/en/master/reference/configuration.html#language-server-phpstan-enabled).

This decreases the maintainence burden by assuring that they always work, on
other hand it increases it by requiring community initiatives to be merged
into the monorepo, but so far this hasn't been a huge issue.

### Highlights

Some highlights from the
[changelog](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md):

- Added native WR single-pass diagnostics #1700
- Index clean command #1691 @mamazu
- Support for mixins
- Docblock completion
- Support for type assertions via. `is_*`, `instanceof` etc
- Array shape type support (types and basic completion)
- Support for variadics
- Send rename file request to client when renaming a PSR class
  @przepompownia
- Generics mostly supported
- PHPStan, Psalm and (experimental) Behat extensions are now included by default.

### Type System and Flow

Refactoring the Phpactor type system was the main motiviation for the change to the monorepo as it is something that affects many of the previous satellite packages (of which there were some 50 or so).

The new system gives it some level of parity with the Phpstan and Psalm type
systems while the flow analysis is much better than it was, but still lacking
when compared to the static analysers.

### VS Code

The [vs-code extension](https://github.com/phpactor/vscode-phpactor) has had
some attention. Phpactor is now automatically downloaded and installed on
extension load and it is neatly packaged as a
[vsix](https://github.com/phpactor/vscode-phpactor/releases/latest) file.

Many VSCode specific bugs have been fixed.

### Diagnostics

Phpactor now has a "single pass" diagnostics engine which is easily
extensible, for development purposes Phpactor now also provides `phpactor
analyse` which works just like PHPStan or Psalm:

![new diagnostics](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUcW7YPWUAEMboa?format=png&name=small)
*`phpactor worse:analyse`*

As it only has about 4 "rules" and is about 4x slower than your favourite SA
tool I would **not** recommend using it for that purpose. The engine does
however provide a good way to highlight when a code action can be applied,
e.g. remove missing imports:

### Sponsorship

[Marcel Pociot](https://twitter.com/marcelpociot) reached out to me to let me
know that [Tinkerwell](https://tinkerwell.app/) uses Phpactor under the hood
(albeit a modified fork), and has provided sponsorship of â‚¬100 a month for
which I'm very grateful ðŸ’— (and also to my other sponsors). 

Working on a language server is an incredibly time consuming hobby, especially
when it's as badly written as Phpactor is, maybe one day I can get enough
sponsorship to write it properly.

In addition I registered a [Blackfire](https://blackfire.io/) open
source license to help improve Phpactor's performance.

### Musing

The monorepository has made the project far easier to contribute to, but lots
of the code is, I fear, difficult to understand and lacks some unifying
principles (although progress has been made). The self-inflicted maintainence
burden is still quite high, it's still the case that a "quick" improvement can
quickly expand into 4 or more hours of my day, and some "bugs" resurface again
and again (looking at you, `UnusedImportProvider`). Saying that, it's also the
case that I've fixed 3 bugs in the hour before starting work, so it's not all
bad.

I increasingly feel that I am actively writing (tolerably well tested) legacy
code, and perhaps more time needs to be spent on refactoring the code base.

One such refactoring would be to create a [Intermediate
Representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation) on
top of the AST. Such a thing could be seen as a DOM document for code, and
following in the footsteps of frontend libraries such as React (I think, I'm
not a frontend person) it could be updated incrementally and not rebuilt from
scratch all the time. 

Nodes in the IR would be augmented with type information and the IR would also
include Docblock nodes.

Ultimately it could mean:

- Vastly improved performance for diagnostics, completion and just about
  anything else that depends on static analysis.
- (theoretically) lossless abstraction (no more
  re-parsing/re-traversing the raw AST)
- Can analyse Docblock and PHP nodes with the same API

I kind of imagine the document being broken down into _blocks_ which are
defined by scope (e.g. an `if` branch is a "block") and atomic text edits
would affect a single block, which may in turn have children which depend on
it and are affected by the change, or not. But much more thought needs to be
applied to this crazy theory.
