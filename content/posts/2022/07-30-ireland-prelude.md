It's been 2 years since I [blogged about about a cycle tour](/touring), but
only one year since my tour: I cycled with a good friend from Paris to
Ouistream, taking in the Normandy coast. It was a a slower paced and more
relaxing tour, which ended with me sailing to the UK.

This year I will be going on another solo tour.

The original plan was to visit all of the [Inviqa](https://inviqa.com) offices
in the UK. There always has to a goal, and visiting Glasgow, Sheffield,
Manchester, Leeds, London and Brighton sounded appealing, I also considered
doing collecting money for charity for the first time.

After briefly looking into it (how to collect money for Ukraine), I couldn't
find a reasonable, easy, way to collect money and somehow the idea of doing
these things for charity adds pressure and stress and I decided to duck out..

Instead I setup a monthly donation to the [Come Back Alive
organisation](https://www.comebackalive.in.ua/) and would encourage you to do
so too.

So that left me with visiting all the Inviqa offices. The more I thought about
it the less appealing it was - I had already cycled much of the UK (albeit not
recently) - I really wanted to discover a new place - I wanted an "adventure".

While I sit here in Berlin, my bicycle is currently at my brother's place in
south-west Scotland (the [subject of my last
tour](/blog/categories/scotland2020/)).

*Where to go?*

So this would be the starting point in anycase, and then I had an idea:
Ireland!

For some reson I had not thought of it before. The ferry to Ireland is less
than 50 miles from my bicycle's current location, and, most significantly, I
have never been to Ireland.

There is a coastal cycle route which is part of the
[EV1](https://en.eurovelo.com/ev1/) which stretches from Norway to southern
Spain.

*EV1*

This section is 2,500k (or so) long. After Ireland I'll cross over to Wales
and make my way to see my parents in Weymouth.

I have **two months** for this trip, I expect the Ireland leg to take between 3
and 4 weeks. After that I don't know. Maybe I'll carry on cycling, maybe I'll
hole-up and do something different.

Not sure what to expect on this tour, although I am looking forward to seeing
the [mountains in the
south](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_mountains_in_Ireland). I have
not done any training for this tour and am kindof expecting the first few days
to be tough.

I will fly out to Glasgow on Monday and expect to start cycling at some point
after that.
