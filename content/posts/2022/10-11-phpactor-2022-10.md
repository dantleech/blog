Today I have tagged version [2022.10.11](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/releases/tag/2022.10.11).

This is the first (and hopefully not the last) monthly release, the full
changelog is on the [release page](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/releases/tag/2022.10.11). I'll run through some of the highlights in this post.

## Generate Decorator

Thanks to the perserverance [mamazu](https://twitter.com/mamazu1995) there is
now a code action to generate a decorator:

This is an LSP only action, and must be invoked in a file with an empty class
which implements one or more interfaces.

I'm really happy to see this, I don't use decorators often, but when I do I
always think "this should be automated". Now it is ðŸŽ‰

## Goto Interface Definition of Method Declaration

This is a very minor feature, but also surprisingly useful. Before the
[ticket](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/issues/1883) was raised I hadn't
really considered it.

Given you on method in a class which is implementing an interface (`<>`
below):

```php
interface Foo {
    public function bar(): void; // will jump here
}

class FooImplementation implements Foo {
   public function b<>ar(): void
   {
   }
}
```

You can now jump to the signature in the interface by invoking "Goto
Definition" on the signature in the implementation (`bar` in the case above).
The inverse operation is the existing "Goto Implementations" action.

## Class String Template and Better Generics

The code for generics has been improved significantly, and while there are
still some features to come (e.g. injecting template vars through the
constructor) these features will now be much easier to implement.

This release:

- Fixes the behavior of `iterable` generics when multiple levels of inheritance are used ([#1875](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/issues/1875))
- Supports the use of method-level template vars. (e.g. `@param T` and
  `@return T`)
- Supports the use of `class-string<T>`

The last feature is quite exciting:

{{<video src="https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/FevFtRIXEAMLyPx.mp4"
caption="class-string template param" width="700">}}

Given the following class:

```php
class Container {
    /**
     * @tempalte T
     * @param class-string<T> $fqn
     * @return T
     */
    public function get(string $fqn): object
}
```

When you call `$foobar = $container->get(Foobar::class)` Phpactor will be able
to infer that `$foobar` is an object of type `Foobar`.

A wild usage can be seen in the [valinor library](https://github.com/CuyZ/Valinor/blob/master/src/Mapper/TreeMapper.php#L10-L22), something like:

## Dedicated Stubs

Previously Phpactor used [PHPStorm
stubs](https://github.com/JetBrains/phpstorm-stubs) exclusively (by default at
least) - that was
until I realised that a bug with `enums` was caused by this library - namely
that the `interface BackedEnum` [has a
property](https://github.com/JetBrains/phpstorm-stubs/blob/master/Core/Core_c.php#L920).
The parser wasn't happy about that and subsequently enums had no method
completion.

Phpactor now has a few "dedicated" stubs. This allows us to fix the enum
"issue" above, and also, mainly for testing purposes, be able to depend on
fundamental stubs like `Iterable`, `ArrayAccess`, `IteratorAggregate`, etc.

## Summary

There are more bug fixes and improvements listed in the
[changelog](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/releases/tag/2022.10.11),
including a significant performance improvement for large documents.

I know that performance _is_ still an issue, especially with very large
and complicated source files. I've been thinking about ways to improve it. One
possible way would be to distribute the language server work over multiple
processes (e.g. diagnostics, completion, code actions, etc), which would allow
the use of multiple cores. This isn't trivial however and adds more
complexity.

Another option is investing more time into untangling `WorseReflection` which I
_suspect_ to be highly inefficient, if it's not highly inefficient then it
could at least be made to be more efficient, or at least, intelligible.

Next month should see the final pieces of the generics puzzle fall into place.
