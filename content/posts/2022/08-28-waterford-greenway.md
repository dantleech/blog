*Map*

I'm now 70k or so from the Ferry terminal in Roslare, if I can wake up at 8am
I should be able to make it to the ferry terminal easily for the 17:30
boarding cut-off. Until I got to the campsite last night I thought it would be
at least another 3 or 4 days, but I am now in "get out of Ireland" mode.

*Midleton - lots of Ironman stuff here*

I rose quite late from my tent to see the Austraian girl had just packed her
stuff opposite me, I made breakfast - coffee and cereal with water - and
proceeded to pack up my tent. I was hoping to have a chat with the girl that
had cycled across Europe but it seemed awkward to go over purposefully to
start a perhaps unwanted conversation. As it happened she was quite slow in
packing and leaving and I managed to say hello as we were both ready to leave,
she is finishing her current "tour" in the next town where she secured a job
for Autumn.

Could I ride on the busy dual carriageway which I would join immediately after
exiting the campsite? The road that ran all the way to Roselare? It turned out
that yes I could, and there were lots other cyclists on this busy 100kmph
road, which almost always had a hard-shoulder which matched the size of the
car lane, giving cyclists (or pedestrians) plenty of safe space.

I was going relatively fast, at least for the load I am carrying, innitially
averaging 25kmph. Occasionally a road cyclist would overtake me, and after
having done so, I noticed that they were not going significantly faster than I
was and I passively tried to keep up a good pace. I was listening to Guns 'N
Roses and using what I assume is my new muscular ability to drive my bicycle
forward, pushing down on the pedals with the front of my feet, knowing all the
while that my pace wasn't sustainable and indeed after 10k or so my ankle
started giving me issues and I had to slow down, and for about 5 minutes
questioned if I had just incapacitated myself for the rest of the day, but it
cleared up pretty shortly and I took care to pedal more on my left, giving the
right a rest.

It was going to be a monotonous day I thought. 110k on a national road with
the aim of reaching a campsite near Waterford which would give me the ability
to catch the ferry the following day. It wasn't going to be an interesting day
and this blog post would have been short.

As it turns out that only applied to the first 60 kilmometers. When I reached
Dungarvan I noticed there was an abundance of cycle hire shops and mention of
a "Greenway" - the Waterford Greenway. I looked it up on the internet and it
ran along an old rail line for 47k. This was perfect, as it meant that I:

- **would not be on a busy road**: the entire route would be cyclists and pedestrians.
- **would go fast**: the don't like to build railways that climb hills
- **would not be bored**: it's a tourist attraction

*Greenway*

It was as I imagined it, I maintained a clippy 20kmph average for 40k,
slipping past numerous other cyclists (only 1 cyclist overtook me). Cyclists
came from the other direction in groups, sometimes I wouldn't see anybody for
10 minutes, and then there would be 10s of them together.

*400m tunnel*

The Waterford Greenway offered a view of the Ballyhoura mountains a 400m tunnel
and a vertigo inducing Aquaduct. For extended distances I would attempt to
ride no-handed and with my back straight, giving it some much needed relief,
but doing so is also a challenge with two unevenly weighted panniers on the
front wheel.

*Fairy installation*

The town of Tramore was the location of my campsite, it was on the EV1 but not
on the Greenway which I left 6km from it's end (or rather it's start) in
Waterford. I had phoned ahead to the camping park to make sure that they were
open and what time the reception closed, it seems there were two parks but
only this one was to be found on Google or my OSM map.

The campsite wasn't all I had hoped for for €14 a night. While it had a games
room, the games room didn't have a table that I could work at. It had no
kitchen or dinning room either, so I was to cook in my tent again, but today I
had no pasta sauce so an post-camping cycle trip was required.

I went down the road to the sea front. It was _packed_ there were buskers
playing on the promenade and a funfair with roller-coasters and spinning rides
and people screaming and seagulls shitting and fish and chip shops and ice
creams.

At the end of the promenade was the supermarket, an Aldi, I found Pasta Sauce,
bread, and chocolate, and all at a very reasonable price. I should've shopped
in Aldi more often.

*Tree person*

I decided to forgo the shower for €1.50. Most campsite showers in Ireland
(maybe everywhere else) cost between €1 and €2 euro a pop for anywhere between
2 and 5 minutes and it's frustrating, especially when the campsite costs more
than average to start with.
