*Map hostels and campsites (route in purple)*

I've got a small tent. A small and expensive tent. I used to have a lovely
2 man Colemans tent. It had a porch big enough that I could stack all my
baggage up in it and the entire side of the tent would open up, it would fit
comfortably on my rear rack. I got the small expensive tent because weight. It
was only after buying this tent that I don't care about weight, I care about
space.

Today has been a very long day. I was in a desert of hostels of campsites, it
was made even longer my my constant indecisions. At around 2PM I searched for
places to stay - there was nowhere on the route, nothing. I eventually found a
hostel about 10k or so _north_ from the route, it was 10k north and
considerably longer. I phoned ahead and the hostel was closed for
maintenance, but, through Google I located a campsite next to it (it was not
on my [OSMAnd+](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.osmand.plus/) map). I phoned ahead and said I may arrive late "click click clack
clack" "what mate?" "hello" "click clack" "hello?" "hello" "hi". I told him I
would arrive late and he didn't ask any questions and said "no bother".

So I had one option, but it was a long one. But this isn't exactly true, there
_were_ other options. There was a hostel en-route which cost €140 euro for a
night and some other hotels and B&Bs out of the way, of which the cheapest was
€80. I decided to head in the direction of the hostel.

The cycle paths in general can sometimes seem like they want to kill you. It's
true that they avoid the roads, but after cycling for 6 hours you are on a
perfectly quiet road which is _flat_ then "EV1 THIS WAY!" you turn the corner
and there is a big fucking hill - "THANKS EV1!". Or you check the map and
there is a perfectly straight road and then the cycle route which zig zags
away from your destination and adds an addition 10 kilometers to your trip.

I took some shortcuts, and so my total journey was 140k instead of 170k.

Today was also extremely hot. I met an cyclist from the US (Washington DC). I
was approaching a convenience store and saw a bike with very old paniers on
the strapped on, I wondered if it was a tourer - there wasn't _much_ baggage.
As I parked my bike he approached me, a guy maybe in his 60s. We had a chat,
and he said that he's done this route (well, he's cycled around the entire
country) several times, and today was the hottest he's ever known it, and
usually it was rain.

In my subjective experience so far Ireland is a hot country. Today especially
so. My hands are red, I think my feet are sunburnt.

Where did I start today? In Meadow Field Campsite. Before I left I tried
partially to download some music on the Wifi but it was very slow and I only
got 2 albums. For some reason I don't want to use my mobile data, as I'm so
used to having a 500MB roaming limit - but - I don't think that's the case,
neither in UK or Ireland. It seems I can now just use my normal data allowance
as if I'm in Germany.

While I was speaking to the American he mentioned Euros, in the shop I have
paid in pounds and I checked my wallet, and she had given me euros in change
and the road signs are in kilometers. For some reason seeing the road signs in
kilometers made me want to cycle on the wrong side of the road (they still
drive on the left as in the UK).

*EV1 and Kilometers*

I had a bit of trouble with my bike early on, the front tire was almost flat,
and I had to unpack 90% of my gear in order to find the pump. I don't think
it's a puncture, but rather the valve. It's a "presta" (?) valve which had
recently "popped off". I inflated it again and as of now it has gone down
again, but not to a worrying degree. I've made a mental node to always get
Schroder (car) valves from now on.

I didn't wild camp, but was seriously considering it at various points. The
road was relentless (at least when following the cycle path) and I began to
question if I would make it to the campsite.

Maybe it was the sun going down, or maybe it was the large amount of chocolate
I ingested, but the last 2 hours were not so bad.

As I approached the campsite I was greeted with some ruggedly beautiful
terrain. I climbed over a few hills and descended into a little valley where
the campsite is. I'm in the corned of a very large and sparsely populated
field, I can't hear my neighbors and they seem quite pleasant anyway. It cost
€15 again, which is perhaps a bit steep considering there is no kitchen and
the drinking water for all the campers seems to be provided by a single tap in
the field. But I can't complain, I will sleep well tonight.

For dinner I cooked the remainder of my pasta from last night and used the
rest of the bolognaise and cheese and drank a cider.

My laptop is now on 10% or less, I think I can partially charge it from my
battery pack, but have to be careful not to leave enough power for the phone.
I'll need to recharge soon.
