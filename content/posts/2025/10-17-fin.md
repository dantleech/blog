Broken sleep in the dormitory due to snoring and ingress and egress of the
room no matter how considerately done. It's dark in the morning now, the sun
doesn't come out until almost 8am. I wasn't cycling today, that much was
clear and I felt a bit lost. Breakfast was included in the hostel price.

The room had a sink. There were toilets in the hall. The toilets did _not_
have sinks. This is bizzare. As if I were to perform my duties or brush my
teeth I would have to use the sink in the dormitory. I had to use another facility on
another floor after using the toilet rather than walk into the dorm and
disturb everyone.

I was now eating for a normal day. I find it odd that my calorie intake isn't
dramatically different based on if I'm riding 100 miles or sitting on my bum
all day. I think I excercise in order to eat.

Lots of time at breakfast spent staring into the void, then staring out of
the window, posing my hand on my chin and looking thoughtful. I wasn't
thinking of anything, I was searching for something and I couldn't find it.

Gathered my things and had to remove all my sheets and put them in the
laundry. I sat in the reception area and stared this way and
that way. Knowing that the train would leave either at 10am or 12am - and that
it was probably safer to get the early train and get to Caen 3 hours earlier
than necessary - from Caen it's a gentle 17k ride to the ferry in Ouistreham.

Leaving the hostel I rode the short distance to the station. I was dressed in
my regular clothes, the cycling gear stashed in my bag, my helmet hooked onto
the rear bag. I peacefully purchased a ticket, waited 20 minutes for the train
and got on it and did some unpaid project-maintainence for the hour-and-a-half
it took to get to Caen.

I rode slowly from Caen, the sun was out, it was probably the best weather of
the trip. It would've been a good day to ride the final 100 miles but the late
ferry was fully booked.

*Riding slowly from Caen*

"Non messieur, on n'a pas des sandwiches vegiterienne, desole" I struggled to
find vegetarian snacks, finally opting for a cheese-pizza.

*The sun was out*

I rode past what I imagined to be a small, unofficial, refugee encampment.
A wall of debris delimited an area with several black-skinned people sitting
about and they happened to be speaking in raised voices. It looked
like a junk-yard, but there were portable toilets placed there, I guess by the
local council. It was the same on the way in, and I'm pretty sure it was there
when I visited last 4 years ago. It reminded me of "homeless" camps in Berlin.

At the terminal I had two hours to wait and I worked on unpaid
project-maintainence and had a coffee.

*Ferry Terminal*

Finally I rode my bike out of the passenger terminal to the car check-in,
passed through passport control, waited for about 30 minutes in a tented lane
for bikes and bicycles, was the first vehicle to board, and the only cyclist.

*The tent is a welcome improvement*

Since then I've been sitting in this seat working on unpaid
project-maintainence and now this blog. I have some hours on the ferry.

This concludes the Road to Mannheim. I expect I'll follow up with a summary
post about the gear and the bike and what worked and what didn't.
