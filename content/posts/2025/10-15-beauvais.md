I was greeted enthusiastically by the AirBnB host, the automatic gate at the
back and I wheeled my bike inside and parked it on the terrace. The shower was
occupied I waited, I showered. Upon getting changed I suddenly felt ill. I lay down and woke up an hour later having dreamt strange dreams and being monetarily confused. I had stomach issues and I didn't feel hungry but I decided it would be better to eat.

Perhaps the reason for the illness was that today was the toughest day so far.

*Unimpressive*

I woke in the budget F1 hotel. It was pitch black as the window opens directly
onto the car park. Breakfast was cheap and  sufficient. I looked for an AirBnB in Beauvais and found one for
about Â£37. "j'ai une velo, est-ce c'est possible de le stocker dans une ort securise?" I asked (I have a bike, is it possible to store it in a secure place?). I marvelled at my apparent fluency in French. The host replied that it wouldn't be a problem. My linguistic confidence was short lived however as it dawned on my over the next hours that "ort" is a German word.

The weather was gray, grayer in the morning than in the afternoon, but gray and uninspiring throughout. Today would be another ~100 mile (161k) day but I felt pretty confident, the total ascent was about half of what it was yesterday.

*Trail 1: difficulty beginner*

To start with it was very boring cycling, then the course took me down a infrequently used road for some kilometers, the deeper I penetrated I saw, over the plentiful vegetation, lakes, and old caravans, and evidence of human habitation, the road was bumpy. For some reason I was reminded of the hill-billy survival-horror novel "Deliverance". I made it out however with my virtue in tact.

*Trail 2: difficulty easy*

*Trail 3: difficulty downhill*

*Trails are roads*

The course would pass through the towns of Soissons and Compiegne. There was a
cathedral at Soissions and a chateau at Compiegne. I decided not to go inside
the cathedral and the chateau was underwhelming so I didn't take a photo of
it.

*Soissons Cathedral*

I listened to Guns and Roses "Use your Illusion II" and, for the first time
Kate Bush's "The Dreaming" and then I lost interest in listening to music for
the remainder of the day.

*Try not to loose your head*

My computer registered an upcoming climb, but was on an
"route national" a very busy road[^verybusy], with no climb in sight, and wondering why
**the line** was on the other side of the road, **the line** then turned
sharpy left and but I couldn't see a path. On closer inspection I saw a rough
path leading directly into the forest. I waited for a good break in the
traffic and rode across and pursued **the line** it became steep, then
steeper. I was riding up a dirt trail, and steeper again and, whoops, too
steep to cycle. So I started pushing my bike, I saw the gradient was 22% at
one point but it may have been steeper. The effort has strained my calf. I
made it to the top and had an good ride over the hill, the descent was as
steep as the ascent and I slowly picked my way down shifting my weight to the
back wheel. I could hear strange bird calls and there were huge trees and lots
of different plants, and I felt like I was in the land-of-the-giants, it felt
wild - and then I exited into a village.

*Didn't realise I'd be pushing my bike up the next bit*

*Looking down*

*Descent*

Later I was traversing the forest towards Compeigne. It felt like
what I imagine Sherwood Forest to be like and that I may get jumped by Robin Hood and his Merry band of
thugs. There were sign posts dotted throughout at "roundabouts". The cycle
path was asphalt but that was the exception.

*One of the signposts*

*Close close upp*

In Compeigne there was an important chateau, but I took this photo instead:

*This road probably leads somewhere*

After all the trekking I was feeling exhausted and wasn't encouraged by the
sign for "very hilly route this way":

*Massiv*

But my cycle computer put me at ease, there would be no more significant
climbs.

*Beauvais*

I'm now sitting on the bed in the AirBnB. My eyes are pulling themselves
closed. I ran out of toothpaste yesterday. I'll see if I can steal some from
the shared bathroom.

*That was a vege-burger, I hope*

Tomorrow is potentially the last "long" day. If I can do 100 miles or so
tomorrow, Ouistream is then 60 miles the next day, and the ferry would leave
at 16:30 and I could be back in the UK on Friday.

[^verybusy]: the fact that I was on a route-nationale was suspicious in-itself
    as the routing avoids these roads.
