It feels like this year has passed rapidly and without incident. Writing these
end-of-year posts helps me remember what has happened. The vast majority of
my days were filled with client work, my weekends often with other programming
related projects, and my evenings often spent running or cycling before
sitting in the slob position and drinking beer, eating pizza and watching
Netflix.

Windows and Chimneys
--------------------

The year started with 3 storey-high scaffolding around my flat, scaffolding to
replace my windows and **fix the damp seemingly eminating from the chimney**
stack. The windows were replaced and I did some rare DIY to strip the decades
of peeling paint and rust from my window guards.

![current "rack"](/images/2025-12-28/janflat.jpg)
*Much harder than I thought it would be*

The windows that came with the flat were blown and opened from the bottom and
were prevented from opening very far by the window guards above. This meant
that:

- They were not very pretty.
- They prevented an unobstructed view of the sea.
- In case of fire the windows were not an escape route.

*New window*

Now in case of a fire I can leap head first out of the window and onto the
busy road below 😌

After three months of scaffolding the roofer told me that **there was nothing
wrong with the chimney** but that there were lots of plants growing on it and
so maybe it's worth reflauching (replacing the mortar). That done I went up
there 5 days later to see plants growing on it again. I had no confidence that
anything had been fixed, and in December, long after the scaffolding had come
down, my roof **had an actual leak**, probably from the flaunching of the chimney,
so that was great.

## Leaking Pipes

The leaking pipes were another issue this year. Two pipes, in two flats,
leaking at the same time and seemingly being impossible to trace. My neighbor
phoned me one Saturday morning in June to say that there was water leaking
through her ceiling. I had to find out where my stop-tap was and that turned
off the leaking stopped and I spent the rest of the weekend without water
until a plumber could be found.

The plumbers pulled up my kitchen floor and found no leak, nor any trace of
one. **Not a sign**. We turned the water back on and nothing. I got into the
habbit of only turning my water on when absolutely necessary, and then as I
realised it wasn't leaking tunring it on only during the day.

Incidentally my neighbor observed that there was a damp patch in the hallway,
below _her_ flat. Seemingly coming from _her_ kitchen. But she had plumbers
round seven times and they never found anything, so it must be _my_ leak.

I paid £700 for a leak detector to come round and say that he couldn't help me
and I invested money in a (somewhat useless) infrared camera and a (more
useful) endoscope.

When the leak eventually happened once more (and this time very evidently) I
was able to get mildly electocuted by the pipe and was also able to find the
leak myself with my endoscope and the plumbers came round and destroyed more
of my kitchen and made a cowboy repair "kitchen fitters" he said in disdain
"they 'aven't got a clue". I don't know about kitchen
fitters, but his work was fucking awful but at least my now-wobly pipes were no
longer leaking and I had th confidence to put my floor back together.

![Floor](/images/2025-12-28/floor.jpg)
*Hole in my kitchen floor and dampness*

This was only **half the story however**, as during this time there was still
water dripping into the hallway, and as **seven** plumbers said there was no
leak from my neighbors flat, it was on me to prove that it wasn't coming from
my flat.

So, every single day, I would poke a carmera into a hole in the ceiling to
observe the water that was very slowly dripping and was slowly destroying the
ceiling. The funny thing was **it happened even when my water was off** and it
**stopped when my neighbor went on holiday**.

*Waterhole*

This went on for months in my desperation I made a report, which included
pretty clear evidence of the exact pipe that the water was coming from:

*Yes, I tried to make a 3D model*

The relationship with my neighbor seemed to sour and she stopped talking to
me. The **eighth** plumber to visit her flat **disregarded** my report
(apparently) but found the leak in the exact same place I said it was in. The
outcome of all of this is that the hall has a holes in the ceiling and the
paintwork is ruined.

The lesson learned is that fixing a problem in your flat is hard, fixing a
problem in somebody elses flat when they seemingly want to ignore the problem
is nigh-on-impossible.

## Talks and Conferences

I started the year by attending PHP South West in Bristol and giving a talk
on the "One Hour Expressoin Language"
([video 📹](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVuMFdYdJ2g))- in which I live coded
a lexer, parser and evaluator in one hour using test-driven-development. It
was ostensibly a talk about parsers, but really it was about VIM and test
driven development, in fact I was worried it could be seen as me **showing
off how fast I am at coding in VIM** for an hour, but it was well received in
Bristol so I thought I'd try and do it at a conference which resulted in
March.

In March I gave a workshp on the expression language theme in **Norfolk** at
the [Nordev](https://2025.nordevcon.com/) conference. There were seven people
in the workshop, two of whom didn't have laptops, but it was fine, and I had
fun at the conference in Norwich and managed to squeeze in a
[Parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/norwich/).

Shortly afterwards I flew to **Barcelona** to run a Marathon and from there flew
to **Amsterdam** to talk at the Dutch PHP Conference
([video 📹](https://phpconference.nl/session/value-objects-and-you/)). I
rehearsed this talk extensively the day before, repeating it over and over
again, and making changes and drawing silly pictures and finding comic
timings - and it seemed to go down well, I only got two reviews but they were
both 5/5 (and not from people I know 🤣). I got extremely drunk in the after
party but managed to queasily make it to the [Amsterdam
ParkRun](https://www.parkrun.co.nl/amsterdamsebos/) with Mike Lehan obtaining
a near-all-time-worst, but considering the pain my brain was going
through it was an achievement.

In May I visited [PHPDay](https://www.phpday.it/archive/2025-edition/) in
Verona as a paying attendee, but gave a lightning talk about [XDebug
TUI](https://www.dantleech.com/blog/2025/05/11/debug-tui/) - which I continued
to work on this year.

![PHPDay](/images/2025-12-28/phpday.png)

In June I revisited Bristol to give the Value Objects talk to a select group
of Bristolians ([video 📹](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFvU9PlwuRA)).

Shortly afterwards I gave my "One Hour Expression Langauge Talk" at
[PHPDay](http://phpers.day/) in Poznan, Poland. The session seemed to go well
enough, in front of maybe 300 people, but the main feedback I got after the
talk, though very positive, was more focussed on my Neovim skills than TDD or
Parsers, and even then it was from fellow speakers, so I'm not sure how much
anybody took away from it and I decided to put the talk to bed.

October saw me **cycling** (more on that later) to Mannheim to attend the [Unkonf](https://unkonf.de/en) (and to have a
cycling holiday). This saw me giving or conducting an impromptu and rambling
talk about XDebug TUI and Rust for 45 minutes (I thought I'd be talking for
15).

My final conference of the year was the November Symfony Con in Amsterdam. I paid for this
via. my company and was able to reconnect with lots of people I hadn't seen in
a long time. I made another attempt at the Amsterdam Parkrun and did somewhat
[better](https://www.parkrun.co.nl/amsterdamsebos/results/208/).

## Sports

I started this year with high hopes for my running. The new year started with
me running the Broadstone Quarter Marathon and finished in a reasonable time.

*Broadston Quarter Marathon*

In February I made a sudden decision to run the Portland Coastal Marathon - a
greulling trail marathon ([blog
post](https://www.dantleech.com/blog/2025/02/09/portland-coastal-marathon)) -
that was **extremely** painful for the last 5 miles.

At the end of February I achieved my Parkrun PB of
[20:28](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/weymouth/results/528/) and was hopeful to
break the 20 minute barrier by the end of the year, but due to injury this was
the high watermark.

The big event this year was the [Barcelona
Marathon](https://www.zurichmaratobarcelona.es/en/) which, as already
mentioned, was in March. I stayed in some prettty poor accomodation and made a
decision to pay more for accomodation in the future. I was relatively happy
with my Marathon time of 3h30m (or so) and it was on-par with my previous
marathon a decade ago in Paris.

After this I flew to Amsterdam for the DPC conference, but on the second day I
fell over while running over a bridge, rolled my ankle to the ground in pain
and fell over on my face. I hobbled back to the hotel but this would be the
beginning of what would be a lengthly period of injuries lasting until
October - at which point I fell over and hurt my knee which took another two
months of recovery. I tried to concentrate on cycling during this time, but
carried on running possibly making things worse.

The summer featured many cycle rides and as summer passed by I had not done my
annual cycle tour, and, seeing there was a conference in Mannheim I decided to
cycle there in October.

*New "bikepacking" setup*

I invested in an entirely new setup - which was expensive - but I'm glad I
did. The new setup is far more light-weight and I was able to travel much
further than previously and I'm actively looking forward to using it again. As
always I blogged about it in [excrutiating detail](https://www.dantleech.com/blog/categories/mannheim2025/).

I've continued running with the local running club, although less so than last
year, still finding it very difficult to socialise but have had some good
experiences nonetheless.

In total I ran 1,5431 miles and cycled 3,639 miles (ok, probably a bit more by
the time you read this).

## Work and Projects

This year saw me working for two clients at the same time, my work with a
German client gradually dimished while my work with a US client increased. The
result being that I worked a huge number of hours and made more profit than
last year and finally made my **very first pension contribution** at the ripe
old age of 45 (not entirely true, I secured £500 pension by working as a
cleaner in 2006 and will probably have a state pension of some description
from my time in Germany although I'm not expecting much there).


![dtlsoft](/images/2025-12-28/dtlsoft.png)
*New company logo and [amazing website](https://dtlsoftware.co.uk/)*

As for other projects, I've continued to work on
[Phactor](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/) which is now **10 years
old**. It's in danger of being made obsolete by
[Mago](https://github.com/carthage-software/mago) which is either a blessing
or a sadness. Probably a bit of both. I have spent a **ridiculous** amount of
time on this project and not a small amount of effort was akin to hitting my
head against a brick wall. At the same time it's taught me a huge amount of
transferable knowledge and I dare say there's a chance I can make it better -
although the project is as long as piece of string and I wonder if my time
on this earth can be better spent. I
made stickers and distributed them to various people:

*Phactor stickers*

I also worked on [Debug TUI](https://www.dantleech.com/blog/2025/05/11/debug-tui/)
which is my third TUI project. The first I made was
[pttlog](https://github.com/dantleech/pttlog) and was surprised to meet
somebody at SymfonyCon that actively used it. So far I'm not aware that
anybody else on the planet is using Debug TUI, but I've personally found it
very useful for work.

## Writing and Reading

I wrote many thousands of words about my two week adventure
to Mannhiem on the bicycle but I did not write more than one technical blog
post. Which is a shame as enjoyed writing abut [value
objects](https://www.dantleech.com/blog/2024/11/24/php-value-objects-and-you/)
and [DTOs](https://www.dantleech.com/blog/2024/12/28/php-dtos-c-dto-and-you/) at
the end of last year and my only technical blog post this year was written at
the very start of January ([the one hour expression
language](https://www.dantleech.com/blog/2025/01/09/the-one-hour-expression-language/)).

I started writing two other posts - one of which would complete the "and you
🫵" trilogy - but I never found the momentum to finish them.

I found some time for reading and have tried to regain a long-lost habbit of
rising early in the morning and reading for an hour before starting work. I
really enjoyed [The Silk Roads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25812847-the-silk-roads).

## What Next?

I'm _vaguely_ planning to cycle to PHPDay in Verona this year, and would like
very much to finally break my ParkRun PB. My US contract _should_ be extended,
although my German one will likely finish in March and I may look for more
concurrent opportunities. I've submitted to a few
different conferences this year, and was accepted to speak at the [PHP UK
Conference](https://www.phpconference.co.uk/speaker/daniel-leech) in February.
I'll need to spend another (probably) large amount of money on fixing my
chimney and would very much like to not have that responsiblity.
