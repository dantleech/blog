It's now twenty minutes past ten and I have had a few drinks. In the bar 
you stand at a table and a waiter will appear within minutes and aggresively
slam down a 25ml glass of beer for each person and will do this whenever there
is a glass empty unless you explicitly opt-out by placing a beer mat on your
glass.

I had a strange dream last night which culminated in missiles being launched
from Nothe Fort (a victorian fort and tourist attraction in my town) before it
was subsequently struck by a missile that resulted in the destruction of the
fort, a big fireball and a shockwave which caused me to wake up. Vivid dreams
often occur in different surroundings, but this dream stayed with me
throughout the day (there were aligators in it too, which were destroyed with
harpoons...).

I woke at around 7am having had plenty of sleep (despite the dreams) and I had
to consider the best way to approach leaving the dormitory and the building. I
had to, efficiently, considerately, gather all of my various things from the
bunk-capsule, change into my cycling bib-shorts (an act that can only be
reasonably performed within the capsule), gather my things from the locker,
put all the items in their correct places, put my shoes on and then ... I had
to find breakfast. But that made no sense. I had to put my bib-shorts on,
gather my things in the capsule so that I can easily retrieve them, EXIT THE
BUILDING AND FIND BREAKFAST, EAT BREAKFAST, and only then return to the room
and gather my things from the locker before proceeding outside to my bike
(which didn't get stolen) and being on my way. Having decided on that plan of
action I executed it.

*Bike*

My bottom didn't hurt. It's worth mentioning because prevuosuly I had always
cycled in shorts and had shunned cycling wear. It's always been painful. The
bib-shorts make a world of difference, I also purchased some "PUK" cream
(essentially cream for friction sports) and have applied it for the past two
days to my posterior. I don't think I've ever cycled as many miles
consecutively as I have done as of today - and everything is fine.

Everthing _is_ fine, but there are some symptoms. My legs ache (which can be
expected) but also I've developed what I can describe as persistent "goose
bumps" on my upper arms. I'm pretty sure they weren't there before ðŸ¤” but it's
only the texture of my skin, there's no discomfort.

*Everything is fine*

So on a healthy bottom I rode my bike across the bridge to the opposite side
of the river and folowed the river up in the grey weather, playing music on my
music player before leaving the river as I blindly followed the navigation
instructions from the computer.

*Up the river*

When I started the trip I thought France, Germany... and Belgium. I
didn't realise I'd also be cycling through the Netherlands so was surprised
when I did.

*The low-lands*

The weather forcast had been gloomy, so I was happy when the sun came out:

And I saw the worlds loneliest christmas tree:

*Lonesome at the top*

The other thing I didn't expect were mountains in the Netherlands. It turns
out that it's really quite hilly in the South, and I climbed hairpins to an
altitude of about 250m.

*Not so flat*

Linguistically I was back to English. Not that I had to
communicate much in the few hours I was there, I'm sure they would have
understood French or German, but I don't speak Netherlandese (or "Dutch"), so
I spoke English when I ordered my sandwich but I think the lady that made my
amazing sandwich thought I was German. It was a good sandwich and would
sustain me for 4 hours:

*Very safe place to eat a sandwich*

I have been having "phantom" problems with my bike. One is that the front
break lever fails to return to it's original posistion after being applied -
which I can understand if something were obstructing the cable, but nothing is.
It seems to happen in wet weather, but otherwise it's fine. More worryingly I
was unable to change my front gear when riding into Liege, so much so that I
assumed the cable had snapped and would need to get a new one the next day. I
rode in on a single ring and forgot to check it until I left - and it was fine
and it **has been fine**. Then there was the less phantomatic problem of
my SPD pedal shoes not reliably disengaging wih the pedal, but more on that
later.

After passing through the lingusistic grey area I was back into familiar
territory with Germany, it seemed that the weather was cooler after traversing
the mountains of the low-lands and I had to put my cycling gloves on.

*In Deustchland*

As soon as I arrived in Germany I noticed that my Garmin Edge seemed to be
somehow less helpful than it normally was. There were no longer any features
on the map and I was sure that it had neglected to give me naivagation hints
(turn right in 200m). After getting lost I realised that I did not have this
part of Europe on the Garmin. The only way to add new maps is through a
desktop application on Windows, I wasn't going to stop and boot my laptop and
start a VM and install some software to load the new region to the Edge, so I
would do without it. This meant that _I_ would be responsible to follow the
line. This was fine, but it meant looking at the map all the time and matching
my position to that of **the line**, . was able to reconfigure the screen to
include the map but also important metrics such as speed, bearing and distance
to destination:

Unfortunately didn't pass through Titz:

*Tits*

Blindly following the line on my map I missed the turning to the
Fernbandstrasse. I saw the cycle path was parallel to me, and between it and I
was a big field, I was dubious at first "shall I ride across the field?" but
seeing an old man on a bike with his dog I assumed it was fine, so I rode over
the grass and mud casually waving to the confused farmer as I passed, only to realise
there was no access to the cycle path at the end of the field and the field had no exit that
was to my advantage. Riding back over to the road I continued and had to ride
over more fields to join **the line**. It took me onto a curious
path finally to the "Ehermaliger Fernbandstrasse"

*Ehermaliger Fernbandstrasse*

I don't know exactly what a Fernbandstreasse is (speedway?), but it was
curious and fast and led eventually onto billowing chimneys and I stopped to take a photo. There
were people up ahead cycling towards me in the distance. I replaced my camera,
put my foot on the pedal, locked in the left locked in the right, started
**falling over**, continued falling over, my right foot woudln't clip-out and I
fell over, slowly and innevitably, sideways from standing with my foot locked firmly to the pedal. It was an
[SPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimano_Pedaling_Dynamics) distaster.

![Camera/IMG_20251009_152843_017.jpg](/images/mannheim2025/202510072003-evaportators.jpg)
*I fell over after taking this photo*

It's a horrible feeling, nobody would intentionally throw themselves at the
asphault. I instinctively put my hand out to break the fall and **SMASH** I hit
the ground. I got up as quickly as possible brushing the gravel and checking
my wounds. Grazes and bruises. By this point one of the distant people was
passing me "ALLES GUT?" he inquired without slowing down "Jah, alles gut" I
replied. I got back on my bike, monitoring the pain in my joints and an
elderly couple rode past. They ignored me completely.

Crossing from Belgium to the Netherlands it seemed that, statistically, the cyclists were far
more prone to ignore you than engage in the nodding, grinning and waving
game and this persisted into Germany. I'm not sure if this is a good or bad
thing.

After this I seemed to enter a power providing area, big chimeys, massive
buildings and more [pylons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_tower)
than I've ever seen in one place. I also saw an
[excavator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagger_288) on the horizon of what I
suppose was an open-pit mine.

*Kraftwerk*

With 25k to go to Dusseldorf my energy was running low. I'd done 120
kilometers and had eaten three pastries and one sandwich. I stopped at a
petrol station for some chocolate and offered my phone to the assistant to her
confusion before realising the the chocolate bar was clamped under my armpit.

*Just another TV tower (Dusseldorf)*

The hotel is awful considering the â‚¬220 cost. The private room smells of feet,
the walls are made of paper (I can hear snoring from the next room) and the
view is depressing. Apparently there is a world conference for plastics here,
and the hotel prices are through the roof. This is the cheapest hotel I could
find. It turns out there were at least two sofas I could have slept on which
would have provided a better experience all round, oh well.

![Camera/IMG_20251009_173301_425.jpg](/images/mannheim2025/202510072003-hotel.jpg)
*Room with a view*

Tomorrow night is the pre-conference social. Mannhiem is about 280 kilometers
from Dusseldorf, so I'll need to get a train unless I want to cycle for 15
hours. My hotel is already booked for two nights and it cost less than â‚¬220.
