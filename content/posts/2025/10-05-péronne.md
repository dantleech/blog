Currently sitting in under a shelter at a campsite with somebody speaking
rapidly on the phone in an African language which isn't helping me
concentrate, and my headphones are in the tent. My fingers are cold but
I've already put all my thermals on (not that it's _cold_, it's about 12
degrees but still). I tried to book ahead at one of the two campsites earlier
in the day but had no success, but I rolled up to this one and they charged me
€12 and it does at least have place where I can sit down and work although no
power and I only have limited laptop power. I should hurry.

I was woken at 5am by people talking, walking about a showering in the room
above mine. The floors didn't insulate sound. My head was slightly bloated
from the beer the night previously, as was my belly and I questioned if I
needed the breakfast I had ordered. I got dressed and opened my door and the
buffet was in the room directly opposite mine. I helped myself to bread, a
boiled egg, orange juice, two cups of coffee and a croissant. I had no trouble
finished it all and I picked up my few things and went to get my bike. Which
was still where I had left it.

The route would take me east to Beauvais, then
somewhat further before heading up, for about 50k to the outskirts of Amines
before heading East. I had chosen the town of Péronne as my destination simply
because it was about 100 miles away and had some campsites.

The wind was blowing powerfully from the West again, which was _predominantly_ good news. I left Gournay and was immediately placed on a cycle path along what was probably a train line and it ran for about 25k. I knew this because I configured the screen of my Garmin to show the distance to the next waypoint.

I've been experimenting with showing different metrics, later today I changed
the top widget (the one displaying "E" for east) to a compass which gives a
very refined indication of my direction.

The wind has blown down many trees and branches:

I put my music on, although not for long as my MP3 player had about 20%
battery when I left, and when I checked this morning it had 2%. I left the
micro-USB cable at home and I'm going to try and find a new one tomorrow.

The cycle way led me into the city of Beauvais. I could see the [cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauvais_Cathedral) from
some way off, on close inspection it was quite awesome, it's also _unfinished_:

After beauvais the route continued east for some time, and I had the advantage
of the wind, however it later headed north and the wind was no longer an
advantage, much to my frustration.

*Quin-quem-pox*

I passed through Quienquempox which is a village with a funny name.

*Leaving quin-quem*

There was no rain today and the sun came and went as did my jacket. It's not
_cold_ but it's cold enough for the wind-breaker when the sun is obscured and
the wind is blowing.

My food today consisted of breakfast, and then snacks I had purchased at any
open bakery I could find. Today is Sunday, which, in France, means almost
everything is closed. Fortunately I managed to find a few bakeries that were
open in the morning and pre-emptively purchased food for later.

Water became a problem later on however. I have two 500ml bottles and an empty
bottle cage under my frame which I intend to fill with a 2 litre bottle of
mineral water, however I had not done that and I was down to my last 100ml and
was eagerly seeking a public fountain in each town I went through and finally
found one.

The countryside is beautiful, especaially when it's wide open and the wind is
behind you.

*Tunnel vision (rode through 3 times due to traffic!)*

I am in the territory of the [Battle of the
Somme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Somme). I passed a war
cemetery with several thousand war dead.

*7033 soldiers are buried here*

5 kilometers before my destination I found some mud:

And a canal:

Tomorrow I'm heading towards Belgium. I'll be heading through Mons which is "just" 79 miles away and I might consider staying there otherwise I'll see what's beyond.
