I had a vegetarian Pita, it was served in a
bowl and had pineapple cheese, and various other things, and it was surprisingly good. I didn't write this post there. Now I'm back in
the Yust hostel. Which is possibly the best hostel I've stayed in. It's
posh and there's _good_ ambient music playing in the reception area
where I'm sitting now in a comfortable chair, books and plants line the
bookshelves, and plants are everywhere (they're plastic). I have bed two in an eight bed dormitory, and the beds look very well
insulated from each other and each bed has a secure locker that can be opened
with a card. My bike, more worryingly, is stored in the "bike storage". Which
is a huge, open, bike storage facility behind a locked gate - but  I don't
consider as secure as other options (e.g. storing it in the luggage room). The
hostel is actually about 5k from the center of Liege. The dorm bed cost
about the same as my four-star camp pitch in France.

I left the Mons Dragon House at about 9am, after having made an excursion to
the bakery to get some pastries to consume with the free coffee at the house.
They didn't take phone payments, so I had to return an make the excursion
again. I brought Pain-au-Raisin-Pain-Suisse combo, they were oversized and had
icing on top. When I cycled out I remembered that my chain was in a bad
condition and used the oil/grease purchased yesterday to improve it.

It was damp in the morning and the sun would not come out all day.

*Leaving Mons*

The cycle computer took me to a canal, and I rode along it in the grey damp
with water droplets forming on my Goretex jacket and gulls flying beside me
and me trying to match their speed before they'd abruptly and clumsily stop midflight to attack a fish or whatever they do.

The first wonder of the day was the [Str√©py-Thieu boat lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Str%C3%A9py-Thieu_boat_lift). It took some time for me to realise that it was a boat lift, it's an enormous contraption and was the largest boat lift in the world until 2016.

*Stairlift*

Around this area the cycle paths rolled up and down and _under_ the canal
bridge and, with the bike, it felt like a roller-coaster ride.

*The canal running on a bridge*

I decided to buy some water, not wanting to run out of it again, the bottle
cleared my cranks by a millimeter or two. The bottle survived.

*My previous mineral water bottle was destroyed*

The weather persisted to be grey and I rode through what seemed to be a
never-ending chain of towns and schools - for some reason lots of schools and
school kids.

At lunchtime I wanted to have lunch, I looked for lunch places. I **wanted** a
sandwich, I had to leave the computer-provided course  to find food. I
found a "Deli" shop which promised "food to go". I thought "pret-a-manager"
but it wasn't like Pret-a-manager. There were several sandwiches and salad bowls, but they **all had
meat**. I'm vegetarian. There was a falafel salad bowl. I should've taken it
because for the next hours I was breaking down due to lack of sustenance.

This was a lunch disaster. I was hungry, I had 100k to go. I had no food. And
everything felt twice as hard (was it really the case?). I consumed my last
energy gel and started acting irrationally, I went out of my way to deviate
from the course to find losing time. Finally I saw a "Fritterie" on the other
side of some train tracks and I cycled under the railway and up to it and
ordered some friend potato sticks and a cheese croquette.

*Lunch 1*

The food helped, though not substantial, I got some energy back but needed
more and, about 10 minutes, later I passed exactly what I was looking for
without looking for it - a sandwich shop. I decided to buy a sandwich for
later. Cheese, tomatoes, cucumber, lettuce, mayonnaise, eggs, large and cut in half.

Soon afterwards I found myself exiting the never-ending suburbia and I was
headed into a dark forest.

*The Dark Forest*

*Inside there are cobbles*

The forest also provided a **very** welcome opportunity to **pee**. Having done so
it was as if my hearing returned and everything was _calm_ again. I think I
had been holding it in for quite some time due to the lack of ideal
locations.

Belgium is cycle-friendly. I spent the majority of the day on cycle
paths, dedicated ones, either running on the canal or old train lines,
or purpose built paths. But each cycle path looks much like the other and it
was a tough day mentally, I resorted to remembering my poems, [Ulysses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(poem)) and [The
Lovesong of Alfred J. Prufrock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Love_Song_of_J._Alfred_Prufrock). I should learn some more, but these are my favourites.

I stopped to eat the first half of the rather large sandwich, and then decided
to eat the other half. A decision I regretted as the human body really does
have a finite capacity to injest food and the second half would have been
better saved.

*Lunch Two*

But I was now fully fuelled up for the remaining distance.

*Why did I take this photo?*

Physically I felt pretty good today, at least from what I was able to tell.
Despite stiffness and aching in the first minutes I had no pain and was still
able to put in effort even towards the end. I was certainly tired though. The
problem is the brain's processing power degrades and you become concious of
that only indirectly (why can't I do this? why can't I remember that?).

*There were animals*

I passed through a town that had an impressive fort and large cathedral.

![Camera/IMG_20251007_173449_829.jpg](/images/mannheim2025/202510061746-cathedral.jpg)
*Cathedral or Church*

There seemed to be lots of industry on the approach to Liege. There were
a Nuclear power plant:

![Camera/IMG_20251007_174714_103.jpg](/images/mannheim2025/202510061746-nuclear.jpg)
*Nuclear*

And some nice bridges to cross over the motorway:

![Camera/IMG_20251007_175312_911.jpg](/images/mannheim2025/202510061746-bridge.jpg)
*That was fun*

Twice today I had followed the canal path only for it to be closed for
maintenance, requiring detours, one of which was very muddy. The final closure
caused me to swear, I'd have to ride back for one kilometer to find an alternate
route, it was however all my fault as I wasn't _supposed_ to have gone this
far. I had missed the _beep beep beep_ of my Garmin telling me to turn off
while I was singing out loud to Nirvana's Nevermind. I was trying to sing
 harmonies as another way to pass the time, and it was sometimes quite
 satisfying.

![Camera/IMG_20251007_180912_414.jpg](/images/mannheim2025/202510061746-blocked.jpg)
*Access Denied - although this one was my fault*

At this point I still had 20k to go, the original route was roughly "100"
miles, I would be exceeding that somehow, maybe because of the various lunch
detours and path closures.

Once in Liege I had to turn off the Garmin navigation (and google how to do
it) and switched to using OSMAnd+ on my phone to guide me to the hostel.
The last 6 kilometers featured the largest hill of the trip so far, I managed
it will though and was able to switch down gears and power up some of the
sections.

*The computer showing the ascent (hard to take a photo when cycling up a
hill in the dark).

Now I'm here. It's about 88 miles to either Dusseldorf or Cologne. My
"meeting" is in Dusseldorf on Thursday. Tomorrow is Wednesday. So I could
possibly take a rest day in Liege, or cycle to Cologne and then cycle to
Dusseldorf, in anycase there's no possibility of cycling to Mannhiem from
Cologne unless I were to ride 230 miles in one day. So a train will be
required for that. I have no idea.
