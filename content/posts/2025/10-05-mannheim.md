I didn't make any cycling plans this year and the summer flashed past as have
so many other things, including a conference I had intended to attend "all
tickets sold out!". I lamented that I had intended to buy a ticket but my
procrastination had prevented me doing so but, as it happens, a final ticket
was available and it remained only to decide how to get there.

The conference is in Mannhiem, which is in **Germany**:

As I have a client in Germany that I thought it would be good to meet up with
them near Cologne, in retrospect it's actually quite a long way from Mannheim
and Cologne is quite a long way from Dusseldorf, which is where the meeting
is. But I've never been to Cologne.

The problem was that I'm meeting them in exactly seven days from now and
Cologne is abount 400 miles (643 kilomoeters) away. Given my daily average on
the touring bike is 100 kilometers in 6-7 hours, it would be a tough slog, and in anycase I
have toured with my old bike for the [past 12 years](/touring/) - maybe it's
time to try **something new**.

*New gravel bike*

The new bike while being significantly lighter has less than 50% of the
carrying capacity of the touring bike and I had to get a whole new set of bike
bags:

*Full Setup*

The camping gear is pretty much the same. The tent fits on one front-fork and
the sleeping bag, air matress and stove git in a dry bag on the other fork.

I had always assumed that having a sore bum is a natural consequence of
cycling long distances on a bicycle, but apparently it's an option. Instead of
shorts and sandals I'm wearing bib-shorts and cleated shoes. I'm a bit
apprehensive about the cycling shoes as on my first tour I spent about a week
being continuously wet and cold and my heavy cycling shoes were the worst part
of it, since then I've worn sandals and never looked back. Hopefully it
doesn't rain continuously and the cooler weather should mean less sweat and
less irritation in the bottom.

*I left the glasses at home ðŸ˜­*

My other clothes are minimal. Anticipating cold I invested in a thermal top
and a thermal bottom. I've got some miminal cargo pants and a loud Tresspass
Hawiian shirt for the conference.

For the electronics I'm taking my laptop, an old-school [MP3
player](https://www.rockbox.org/), my Garmin watch (that won't last long as I
forgot the cable), two power banks (one that's capable to charge the laptop),
a Garmin Edge cycle computer.

*MP3 player being held together with a cable-tie*

An insfufficient number of tools (I since got a spare innertube and a
spare chain-link), some cable ties, and a little plastic bag, because why not:

I got the train to Portsmouth:

Ferry to France is tomorrow, I'll get to Ouistream (Caen) at 15:00 and then I
start cycling. I'm not sure what I'll be doing after the conference, maybe
I'll cycle back.
