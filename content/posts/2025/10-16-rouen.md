I'm in Rouen. I've been walking about trying to find a pizzeria for about an
hour. My first attempt was an abject failure. I
was directed to a table adjoined to the table of the only other customer in
the shop. It was a small pizzeria and I felt self-concious and I _had no
personal space_ and I'd be intimately concient of my dining partners movements and noises and I hardly wanted to whip out my laptop out and start writing. When the proprietress came to take my order I bottled it and said I had to
leave "desole, je dois partir"

Every subsequent restaurant I passed wasn't good enough, there were too many
people, too few people, the tables were too close together. I started to have
a minor breakdown, eventually I found an **empty pizzeria** and here I am,
although couple have just joined me and I wish there were some music.

This morning I was in ... (_I have to think about it_) ... **Beauvais**. I
woke in the AirBnB at around 7:30 having told the host the night previously
that I'd accept his offer of coffee at 8am. I joined him and he served me
waffles (or _Gauffres_) and I was able to help myself to coffee. We had a good
conversation in French (he didn't speak any English). He was a chef, the house used to
be his restaurant and it was currently for sale. "I try and do a good deed
every day" he said, whether it was giving me free breakfast or giving somebody
a lift from the station. He got 5 star review and I got a good breakfast.

I had decided to head to Rouen. It's about 260 kilometers (160 miles) to the
ferry, which is roughly one and a half days. It would make sense to do the
larger part of the trip first, so I could do the shorter part and get the
16:30 ferry with ease. Unfortunately I didn't find any good accommodation
options west of Rouen, and Rouen had a youth hostel. So it would be a short ride and
then long, which has implications on getting the ferry.

Ok, now my head is spinning slightly, where was I. So I decided to cycle to
Rouen, but not only was the distance below the minimum-acceptable-distance
(MAD) the hostel was probably closed until 17:30. So I decided to add some
more kilometers to the ride and to approach Rouen from the South.

It was another gray day - and colder as evidenced by my gloves still be on my
hands well into the afternoon. My legs had the familiar ache of having done a
hard days work the day previously. But I was taking it slowly - the aim was to
get to Rouen _later_ and not earlier to avoid excessive waiting.

The sun came out very briefly and I could feel it warming the cockles of my
heart until it disappeared and the grey and cold returned.

I headed south as I approached Rouen, I saw a remarkable ruin of an old cotten
mill [Filature
Levavasseur](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filature_Levavasseur). It looked
like a ruined cathedral that lay directly on the river "l'Andelle". Construction was
completed in 1861 and it burnt down in 1874 and has been in that state ever
since.

The "l'Andelle" flowed into the river Seine which I followed to the "Barage
des Poses". A massive dam and lock with a footpath/cycleway running over it. I
stopped to take photos holding my phone in my hand as I rode across with the
fear that it would slip through my gloved fingers, bounce on the footway and
over into the gushing waters below - which would be an inconvenience.

Heading north from there I passed distinctive rounded hills following the
Seine into Rouen.

The hostel was indeed closed, and I considered cycling some more, but I had
reached my destination, I wasn't going anywhere. Luckily somebody turned up in
a car and managed to mostly ignore me and my bicycle at the doorway until the
door was open. She had long leather boots and gothic arm bands and was in here
50s and she unhurriedly got back to me and gave me the room key and guided me
to the bike storage room.

I passed out on the bed for an hour after getting changed. I didn't bother
showering - I had no towel (it would be an extra expense) and it's not as if I
did alot of sweating today. I'd considered doing some work, but it's easy to
think that, and it's another thing when you reach a bed. I also considered
going for a run, but that thought left me. It was an easy day, but I still
felt tired.

I walked into the center of Rouen and had a minor breakdown trying to find
somewhere to eat as detailed at the start of this post On the way I was
interested in the irregular timber framed buildings and big fucking cathedral.

*Whatever this is*

It's slowly dawning on me that I'll need to get a train tomorrow. While I
could get up at 5am and cycle to Ouistreham, I'm not that comitted to cycling
all the way back from Mannhiem. It would have been nice however.
