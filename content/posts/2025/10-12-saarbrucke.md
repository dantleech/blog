Now in a hotel after having walked around in my barefoot shoes for a few hours
in Saarbrüken (where luck can be found according to the advertisements on the
way in). The hotels are quite cheap here and the town is nice. My ankle was
giving me _some_ grief probably due to barefoot shoes and the running a few
days ago. But it'll be fine.

I left Mannheim this morning after having attended the conference yesterday.
The conference was a lot fun, it was in an "unkonf" format where there was no
previous schedule and speakers were selected on the day and anybody could
put themselves forward as a speaker. I put forward two topics, thinking that
each would be a 15 minute presentation, a "lightening" talk - but I got a 45
minute slot and I paniced when I realised that my topic absolutely was not
something to talk about for 45 minutes without any preparation. I came up with
a strategy to expand it, but in the case I crashed through for 35 minutes in
front of an intimate audience and there were lots of discussions and it wasn't
the disaster that I feared it would be, but I think next time I'd prepare
something. I met new people and saw some familiar faces.

After the conference people headed home, I got a lift back to the city and
ended up finshing the day by having chilli-fries with Dave before retiring to
bed.

This morning I organised my things, went out for a coffee and a
choco-brotchen, then packed up my things and wheeled my bike outside leaving
the room card in the room and closing the door behind me. The weather looked reasonably good. No rain, some cloud and the possiblity of some sun:

I rode towards the large hills to the west where it looks rather lumpy.

It was Sunday which meant fewer food options, at 10am I entered a village and
the bakery was open, I ordered a "vege-sandwich" consisting of eggs and
various cheeses, upon paying "es macht **beep-beep-beep**" the lady told me
enthusiastically when the card machine accepted my phone payment
"**beep-beep-beep**!". The people seem very friendly.

Paying with the phone is something of a game-changer, I've previously always
used a card, but this time I'm not even carrying my wallet - although I do
have my cards stashed with my passport and the few bits of cash that I have -
I should probably have distributed them to avoid having all my eggs in the
same basket, although alternate safe-locations are somewhat limited.

*Sandwich purchased here - but would it be enough!?*

From here on I entered the hills, and the temperature dropped slightly, I
passed a few paper factories, one of which looked like it hadn't be active in
some time.

There were also two very similar castles in two very similar
villages, both of which were derelict shells:

I attained my highest altitude and stopped to eat my sandwich:

Excitingly I passed through the village of Frankenstien, but there was no
monster or any reference to one:

I suffered another SPD issue, I stopped at a Garage to grab some more food
(the sandwich was _not_ enough) but as I went to put my unclip my right foot
it just span around but wouldn't come loose. I was able to stop safely and
removed my foot and spent some minutes trying to decouple the shoe from the
pedal. After loosening the clamps I set it free, I had lost one the
cleat-bolts and the cleat was loose and freely rotating. I readjusted the
cleat and fastened the remaining bolt tightly.

I went into the shop, which was effectively a room full of vending machines,
and tried to order one of the choclate bars, "product not available", "product
not available", "product not available" it insisted against the visual
evidence. So I walked out, got on my bike, then realised I had fastened the
cleat in the wrong position so had to fix that.

It's certainly Autumn now as made evident by the brown leaves littering the
ground, and it was scenic cycling, and after passing the hills, quite rapid. I
frequently found myself on lovely cycle paths.

*Autumn cycle paths*

I entered the town of **Landstuhl**. Mentioned only because I had another
SPD failure. The route wanted me to pass through a road that was being
resurfaced. There were pedestrian walkways with shops open either side of the
road, I decided to ride my bike carefully on the walkway rather than taking a
detour. I could see somebody exiting a doorway of a kebab shop ahead of me and
I stopped to let them out, tried to break my foot out - and again - it stuck
and I fell right to the wall, putting my hand out to brace myself. The guy that walked out of the shop gestured to
let me go first - I gestured no - "bitte" - he can go. He insisted that I went, but I
couldn't remove my foot from the pedal, which meant I was likely to just fall
into a wall again after he let me go forward. "Are you ok?" he
asked me with concern thinking I was mad. It did look strange that I was rooted to the spot and
wouldn't move. In the end I had to reach down and remove my foot from the shoe
and spin the shoe round on the pedal to illustrate the issue at which point
a burly Kebab-shop owner came out "was ist passiert?" assuming I had caused an
accident, "nichts, alles gut" I said, "es ist zu eng" he admonished me (it's
to narrow for cycling) "it's too narrow" the guy translated for me before
finally walking away. I wheeled the bike down the street and re-fixed the
cleat and left the clamps loose to prevent another incident.

I did finally find a garage, and puchased my chocolate bar (one of the square
[Ritter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritter_Sport) Sport bars) and two
donuts, one consumed soon after leaving the garage, the other consumed minutes
ago while I was writing this blog. The reamining ride was good cycling and I
consumed maybe .25cl of water, the weather was cool and cloudy, but not
unpleasent. It was an easy day, I got in at 16:30 and I could've easily have
done another 20-30 miles - even if my knees were aching slightly.

At the hotel I was allowed to put the bike in the room:

*Bike in room*

There was a couple being a couple in the next room so I went out for a walk
in my bare-foot shoes, I wandered about the city, my right ankle was causing
me some issues as mentioned at the beginning of this post. I finally went to
look for my Pizzeria, the first was fully booked, as was the second, the third
had places and a mediocre pizza and small beers and I paid and left and went
to a kebab shop to buy beer (because I couldn't find any convenience shops
other than the silly automat-shops which don't stock beer).

Tomorrow I'll continue West. I am going to pass through Metz, and I remembered
that I know somebody there from some years ago, I sent them a mail, but no
reply as yet. In anycase Metz is about 50 miles away, Luxembourg City is abut
70-80 miles away but it seems the Youth Hostel is closed, and the hotels are
.. expensive, so I don't think I'll bother visiting.
