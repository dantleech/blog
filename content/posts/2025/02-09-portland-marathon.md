I stopped running a week before the marathon in order to "train" for it in
order to mitigate the various aches and pains that I was accumulating from
over-training.

Registration closed at 8:30 and my mother, who offered to give me a lift to
the Isle of Portland (about 3 miles from my flat), kindly rang me at 6:30am to
inform me that I failed to wake her up, after which I slept for another hour
before rolling out of bed and making coffee and eating some oats and granola
with honey, reading the latest terrible news of 2025.

My lift was waiting and I left my flat, closing the door before realising that
my keys were inside the flat, breaking out my spare keys, retrieving my
non-spare keys, and restoring my spare keys to their hidey-hole only to find
them waiting for me on the floor when I returned.

I was dropped off and made my way directly to the registration, in the [National
Sailing Academy](http://www.geoffkirby.co.uk/Portland/680740/), in a large hanger accessed by a ramp with some desks at one
end providing the bibs for the 10k, half-marathon and marathon events. I saw
somebody I knew and had a chat, surprise was taken at my road shoes "yeah,
should have invested in some trail shoes really". It was going to be slippy
out, it being for the previous days moist, but the present weather was cold
but clear with a real possibility of the sun coming out.

The race briefing was at 8:45 and I panicked when I realised that my telephone
was not on me, nor was it in my trail-bag. My trail bag contained the
mandatory kit: foil blanket, water, first aid kit, water, nutrition and a wind
jacket which I never used. But my phone was not there, yet I had it. Where was
my phone? I abruptly left the briefing and it flashed in my mind that I had
left it in the car and that it was not only "required" kit, but also that it
was my ride home. Fortunately I had left it carelessly on the table when I was
pinning my number on my chest.

I paced about in anticipation for 10 minutes and then the count down and we
went out. My priority was not to go _fast_ the route is not only a marathon,
but a **trail** marathon, with some very steep climbs and the winner from last
year did it in about 3 hours and 20 minutes, and my target was 4 hours and 30
minutes.

Within the first mile we were already running up the "funnel" to the [Verne
Citadel](http://www.geoffkirby.co.uk/Portland/690735/) - a 250ft climb on what was perhaps once a rail transportation system
to ferry goods and ammunition to the citadel. I got to the top and felt
strong but the goal was to feel strong for the next 26 miles which was a
different matter.

The route would take us around the isle clockwise for a distance of around 10
miles then we would run down the causeway connecting Portland with Weymouth,
under the bridge, run _back_ to the start along Hamm Beach, turn around and
then do the **entire thing in reverse**.

So I paced myself, trying to go easy on my legs, but still running 8 minute
miles along the flats. 

It was not an entirely lonely race and within the first
5 miles there were 3 of us bunched together, at one point I was in the group leader
and, thinking I knew the route, led out party on a minor, unhelpful,
diversion.

The event is **self-directing**. As I had run the route more than a few times, I
was familiar with it - and it's not hard - keep the sea on
your left in the first half and on your right for the second half and every so often there would be some marshals to point direct you
at critical points. But there _were_ ambiguous route choices, this path or
that path, all valid but at different costs. I had the map on my phone, many
had the map on their watch. My phone was stashed in my bag for the entire race
so I wasn't the best person to follow and probably ran an extra mile for that.

I was feeling strong and was happy with my relatively effortless pace until we
rounded [Portland Bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Bill) and I realised that part of the reason it felt so
effortless was that the wind was behind me. Now the wind was against me and
it was cold, and we were also running up a slope.

At the top of the slope is [Portland Lookout
Station](https://intranet.nci.org.uk/portlandbill) and I hesitated after
proceeding down a fork in the path, and turned around to see which way other
runners would go, there was only a single runner behind me and he wasn't
taking my route but I was to far ahead to change course, so I continued, with
the other runner slipping past me and I'd be following him for the next five
miles.

We turned right at (what used to be) [Blacknor Fort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacknor_Fort) - a diversion from the
original coast path due to erosion - which was, for me, a somewhat welcome
relief as it took us back on to the tarmac for a spell and run faster before
we turned into the [Tout Quarry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tout_Quarry)
and making our way to the path precipitous 200ft zig-zag descent from the quarry to sea-level.

At this point my choice of footwear let me down slightly, my road shoes have
had > 500 miles on them and are especially not suited to muddy slidy
conditions, but I _slided_ and _slode_ and made my way to the bottom without any
injury onto the road "out" of Portland and onto the causeway.

Here we continued to run into the wind, down the pedestrian pavement with
traffic on our right and the wind against us, at this point I crossed paths
with the lead runner and I clapped my hands for him (at this
point he was probably 3 -4 miles ahead, having run up the other side and
returned). Sporadically more runners crossed our paths as we made our way down
to and under the bridge to run up [Hamm Beach](http://chesilbeach.org/hamm/).

I felt strong with the wind behind me and was feeling the benefits of the
energy gel I had consumed at mile 10, I passed my companion and turned at the
half way point, seeing more and more runners the other way and clapping for
them and overtaking some more runners which boosted my confidence a bit.

Running back towards Portland I felt strong and lots of marathon and
half-marathon runners and more claps and "well dones" and at one point a high five
before I had to **climb back up the 200ft path to the quarry**.

It seems a couple had gained on me as I started, and my "good pace" turned
into nothing more than a shuffle. It was **very steep** and it was on this
ascent that (as I say in retrospect) my heart rate peeked at about 180bpm. At
the top I saw M. from the running club who offered some words of
encouragement as I started to pick up the pace again, knowing it was now
mostly downhill back to Portland Bill.

At this point I had the beginnings of muscle fatigue, having covered around
17 miles or so and I decided to consume another gel and to increase my cadence
and slow down and managed to take yet another diversion before looking back
and seeing another runner taking a much more direct route back to Portland
Bill.

Meeting the Lighthouse for the second time I turned around and the wind hit me, now
I was shuffling along what really did not seem to be a gradient and had
covered 20 miles. It was not getting easier from here on in and a runner
overtook me "how you holding up?" I asked, "not to bad" he replied. I wasn't
feeling the same, alarm bells were ringing in my legs and I continued to slow
down.

Cramp struck me in my calf, and my calfs felt _tight_ and I knew that cramp
would strike again and my legs were constrained with pain and the threat of
cramp and I shuffled onwards. The (to be) first lady caught up with me and we
chatted a little bit, with me occasionally yelping as one calf or the other
cramped up and I slowed again as she ran ahead. We "ran" up the "Church 'Ope"
steps, or rather, walked. "I'm like an 80 year old man" I said as I bent-over struggled
to barely walk up the many steps, sometimes side stepping like a crab to
mitigate the pain.

At this point I considered walking, but I only had a few miles to go. I was
starting to feel sick.

A requirement of the run was to carry 500ml of water, and I had, for the first
time, used a camel pack. With water in a bladder in the bag on my back, with
a tube feeding out of it which dangled under my arm in convenience to
hydrating me whenever the need arose. It was however _not easy_ to extract
water from it and was something of an acquired skill. So, although the were aid
stations along the way, the event was "cup-less" so I was at the mercy of this
hydration pipe.

The ostensible final challenge was climbing _back_ up the 220ft zig-zag "goat path" to the [Grove Prison](http://www.geoffkirby.co.uk/PortlandArchivePictures/html/grove_prison.html) . My bag
was hurting my shoulders and I felt sick and my legs were cramping up. At the
top I had encouragement from some club runners staffing an aid station and for
the first time I took advantage of the goods on offer and picked up a handful
of Jelly Babies.

It was now the matter of a mild climb for a mile to the Nothe Citadel. I knew
I should've been running 8 minute miles at this point but I was shuffling at
12-14 minute miles thinking that **running shouldn't be this attritional**.

Finally I arrived at the Citadel and it was down the steps and descending
back down the precipitous funnel to the road, turning into the Osprey Quay
where I knew I was minutes from the finish and running 9 minute miles (5:40
per kilometer) on the flat being very aware that any great exception would
result in my calfs exploding in spasms and contractions.

"This way! Well done! run down there and up the ramp!". I ran down there and
ran up the ramp, crossing the finish line. Staggering a little, my vision
blurred. J. came up and said congratulations or similar and a pat
on the shoulder which I returned wordlessly as I staggered my way towards a
chair and sat down and sat down and sat. "Do you want some water?" somebody
asked I nodded "you look like you need it".

When I arrived home I was shaking and went straight to bed in my running gear
for some hours before I warmed up and had some soup and was able to gingerly
descend the stairs to take a shower.
