This year I've decided to cycle across the Pyrenees, again.

2010

13 years ago I rode from St. Malo to Santander and then crossed the Pyrenees
and continued along the coast before crossing the Alpes to Lac Leman. I've
recovered my [sparse
web journal](https://www.dantleech.com/travelblog2010/frontend.php/) from that
time:

This was my first time in France as an adult (I was 30 years old) and the
first time I had ever been in the mountains, I remember it being _extremely_
tough - I lost a tooth - and progress was extremely slow on some days. I had
just discovered that my phone had this thing called "GPS" and I managed to
download some offline maps, but I didn't have any internet. The hills were
_relentless_.

But it was spectacular, since then I've cycled all over

Plan
----

- Sail from Plymouth on the 14th August
- Cycle accross the Pyrenees
- Get the train from Perpignan to Paris
- Get back to the UK via. Roscoff, Cherbourg or Calais.

When I rode this "route" it took me 13 days - with no rest days. This time I
intend to take at least a couple of rest days, and so I'm giving myself 3
weeks.
