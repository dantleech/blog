The only other guy in the room (I guess the dorms are not at full capacity due
to Covid) decided to come in at midnight and start watching a TV program on
his phone with the _loudspeaker_. Forcing me to get out of bed and ask him to
stop it (because he was so engrossed that he couldn't hear me ask from my
bed).

The hostel provided "take away" breakfast but let me sit down in the bar and
also lent me a UK power adapter so that I could use my laptop and upload
yesterdays blog post.

I was on the road by 9am and I was going to cycle into the the "mountains" but
first I had to cross the bridge. There were two large suspension bridge and a
separate victorian railway bridge. One lane was closed but a helpful Scott
told me in detail how to cross under the underpass and use the other side.

_Victorian Bridge at Queensferry - 70 people died building it_

I passed several cyclists and afterwards one of them caught up with me and
had a chat - I spoke with him twice, once in Queensferry and then again
outside Greggs a few kilometers later where I was getting my "Plougmanns".
Scotts are generally very easy going and easy to chat with.

The first "pass" was about 250m according to my phone's GPS altitude and
offered some great views.

_Coming over the first pass_

I then passed through Perth, and on the way I noticed my rear wheel wasn't
turning freely. The wheel had been knocked slightly from it's clamped
position, and when I fixed that, I realised the breaks now also needed
adjusting, so I just loosened them to at least provide some stopping power
while still allowing the wheel to turn freely then stopped at the next
convenient place and fixed them properly.

_Perth_

The rest of the day is a bit hazy, as I'm writing this the day after because
last night I was wild camping. But that wasn't my intention. I intended to
stay in a hostel or a camp site near Pilochry. I remember inspecting some
strange plants which made "cracking" sounds in the heat and they're "pea pods"
were hard to the touch and rang metallically against my knife when I knocked
them, then a cyclist rode by saying "hello" she was touring.

I caught them up as they were not going fast, they were a couple maybe in
their middle to late 20s cycling for a couple of days, both on Furlough to
different degrees. We kept pace for about 30 minutes and then I said goodbye
and went on ahead. They were going to try and "wild camp" at Dunkeld.

_River at Dunkeld_

I also stopped at Dunkeld (getting there before them) and had a beer. I had
done my 100k minimum by now, and the next town Pitlochry was another 30k or
so, and I thought I'd try going there to find a hostel, or a camp site, or
otherwise just find a wild camping spot. The idea of wild camping appealed to
me, but I wasn't sure.

_Can you see Grouse?_

On the way there were lots of, what I think are, "Grouse". They have a funny
way of walking, which resembles Velociraptors from the Jurassic Park film.
They were numerous and easy to scare, although sometimes they seemed to be
running beside me even whilst running away.

The hostel was full and the campsites were caravan parks and receptions were
closed and required a minimum stay in anycase. I was getting desperate but
couldn't make the find a place I felt comfortable to wild camp.

I was forced (by losing my way) to traverse the border of an estate, and by
the river there were numerous places to camp which seemed to have fire pits,
but there were people around, so I skipped those and so I kept cycling, and
cycling, and cycling

On my map I can see green spots, and sometimes those green patches have dotted
green lines on them (forest paths) and sometimes blue lines (cycle paths). I
found a good patch of green with both cycle paths and forest paths - surely I
wuld find a place to xamp there - but when I got there the access road was
private and guarded by a house, but fortunately I noticed another path, which
ran along sinde the river after going under the rail tunnel.

I tunrned in, and there was a gate, secured shut with bailer twine and a
grassy / muddy road leading off behind it. I parked up the bike, opened the
gate and walked down some way. There were signs "WATCH OUT FOR OVERHEAD WIRES"
"MAKE SURE RODS ARE CARRIED LOW" or similar. So this seemed like a public
place, but nobody was here. I saw an initial campsite and decided I would stay
here. I got the bike, then explored a little bit futher up and found the
river and decided to setup my tent there.

_Wild Camping_

I don't usually wild camp and I was a little bit nervous, and probably like
most people my paranois gets turned up a few notches when it's dark. I could
imagine crazy people doing crazy things for crazy reasons. But it's easy to
decrease the volume of the paranoia through reason and common sense, but
harder to silence it completely. Luckily whiskey helps.
