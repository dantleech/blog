It had stopped raining when I woke up, and I slept quite well, only getting
out of bed at 7:50. I ate the little remaining museli I had and had my
mandatory coffee. It was the coldest it has been so far last night, and
pushed the confort limits of my sleeping bag (I slept almost fully clothed).

It was monday morning and I left the campsite, I was going to go in and ask if
they had any camping gaz, but there was a queue so I just left and went to the
supermarket 1km down the road, and did a "big shop" buying one pack of museli,
one pack of pasta, 2 cans of baked beans, a french baguette, a big bag of
mixed nuts, and a separate bag of salted peanuts. Probably other things too.
As I went to pay I noticed that I had stolen the shower-block card from the
campsite. This was bothersome.

It was only 1km back to the campsite, and I decided it was too late to return
it and carried on, it bothered me for the rest of the morning. It was only a
plastic card but I didn't know how much of an inconvenience it is to have one
taken, or if I should send it back. In retrospect I should have dropped it
back.

My first, and as it turns out, only, destination was Flora where I would get
the ferry to Smørhamn. The first part of the route went along the (relatively)
busy E5 main road. Then there was a 5km tunnel which I could not cycle down,
so I had to go over the mountain.

The mountain pass was extremely quiet, not a single car passed me on the 1
hour (?) ascent. The scenery was magnificent and I could see patches of snow
on the surrounding mountains. Afterwards the pass descended and rejoined the
E5 which took me most of the way to Florø.

I had no idea when the ferry would leave, so I hurried straight to the ferry
port. When I got there I saw lots of parked cars, some fork-lift trucks, and
various administrative buildings - but nothing that I recognized as a
ferry port.

Fortunately I had just passed a Tourist Information center, so I went there
for advice, I was told that my boat left at 16:05, and that it also went to
Måløy.

My destination was an island and I was to cycle 20km over wriggly terrain to
reach another ferry port to Måloy. It would maybe be 18:30 by the time I got
to the ferry port, and then I didn't know how often they ran.

I decided to skip the island and go straight to Måløy.

At 15:40 I was at the ferry port, and I could see people waiting in a
disorganized way. There were no signs that I could see indicating what was
happening or what one should do. I asked two girls that were waiting as a boat
pulled in "Are you waiting for a boat?" "Yes" "Is it going to Måløy?" "err,
no. this one goes to the small islands, if I were you I would walk over there",
she pointed, "and ask somebody".

I did, and the man helpfully asked his wife who confirmed that my ferry would
come in at 16:05 after their ferry which came in at 16:00.

The ferries from Florø were much smaller than the "road" ferries, they had
capacity for maybe 3 or 4 cars and 20 to 30 passengers.

On the ferry the ticket collector came around and I said "Måløy" - the second
stop. As my first destination came into view I felt pangs of regret. I looked
fantastic. The other reason I felt regret was because the ticket cost 360kr -
I'm sure it would have been cheaper to stop here and cycle to the other side.

But the ferry was also a good 1.75 hour journey and the scenery was
spectacular - if you like huge mountainous rock islands rising out of the sea.

When we landed there was another supermarket and I purchased another loaf of
bread (the french baguette is actually pretty poor value for money, it doesn't
last long) and replacement Tobasco sauce (tragically I had left my original
sauce in Bergen).

I cycled over the 1.6 bridge to the mainland (on the main road, it wasn't
busy at all). There was a camping nearby and it was around 18:00 so I decided
to just settle down for the day after doing only 75km or so, having spent time
waiting for and being on the ferry.

The signs for the campsite (Stienvik Camping) didn't feature a tent (just
caravan and bungalow) but I tried my luck anyway and turned off on a dead-end
lane for 2km to get there - they did have camping spaces, it did cost 175kr -
almost €19 - the most expensive so far.

The campsite is quite stunning however, and most of it is bungalows and
caravans, the camping section is separated from the rest of it and a very well
kept lawn by the sea. I am the only camper and it is very quiet.

I made progress on my soup recipe by adding an onion - lentils, vegetable
broth, pasta and a chopped onion, best dinner so far. I think I'm eating
better on the road than I do at home.
