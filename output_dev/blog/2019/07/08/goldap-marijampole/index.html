                 <p>Loud music was pounding on the street, I thought I would wait until 12, maybe
it would stop, but I fell asleep before that. In the morning I made my way to
the restaurant to see what wonders awaited me. It was a buffet breakfsat, the
guy spoke to me in German and asked if I wanted eggs "Speigel Eier oder Rugh 
Eier" (and yes, I have no clue how to spell or write in German). It wasn't a
particularly good breakfast, what made it not a good breakfast was mainly lack
of real coffee - they only had instant.</p>

<p>The bike was safely stowed, I packed my stuff, and then tried to do some
research on my route today which would take me into Lithuania. I also purged
the Polish lessons on my MP3 player and replaced them with Lithuanian lessons
before packing up and going downstairs to fetch my bike.</p>

<p>There were two other bikes in the storage area when I pulled in yesterday, and
now they had two people handling them. Two women, I asked which city they were
heading two, they said "Kaunas", I said "me too!". But our conversation didn't
proceed any further, and I wasn't even sure where they were from. After
securing my gear I left and overtook them with a wave after 10 minutes.</p>

<p><em>Road</em></p>

<p>The weather has generally been overclouded for the past days, with intervals
of sunshine. There was more sunshine to start with today, and I wondered that
I hadn't suffered much from the sun so far, I had sun burn on my first days
from wearing a vest, and my lips are cracked (and I have woken up with blood
on them for the past two days), but otherwise I'm good, my feet have been
completely unaffected by the suns rays.</p>

<p><em>Water</em></p>

<p>On the road out of Goldap, I again had the choice of riding the GreenVelo
route -- as I turned onto it I couldn't help but notice that the main road was
far more direct, and that taking the cycle path added another 7-8km. I stopped
and struggled to decide: take the boring main road, get somewhere quickly, or
take the unknown cycle path, which is longer, probably has an awful road, but
would of cource be somewhat safer more interesting. Whenever I'm in doubt, I
choose the hard option, and I'm glad I did, it was certainly slower, but was
much more pleasant, but after 7-10km when it approached the road again, I took
my opportunity to bail and make up some kilometers.</p>

<p>The terrain is getting more hilly, and at one point I was elevated to 300m,
and was offered a panoramic view of the land.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-08/4.JPG" alt="Panoramic" /></p>

<p><em>Panoramic view</em></p>

<p>I stopped at a shop and got an energy drink, and, not finding any peanut
butter, got some bread and a packet of biscuits, unfortunately I did not have
enough Zslotys for the biscuits, which meant that I had successfully spent all
my Zslotys, and when I cross the border I can go back to Euros.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-08/3.JPG" alt="Steep" /></p>

<p><em>Normally I associate the gradient signs with a mountain, but what you see is
all of it</em></p>

<p>I crossed the border to Lithuania - there was no border station, just an
sign with "Republic of Lithuania" surrounded by the stars of the European
Union.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-08/5.JPG" alt="Border" /></p>

<p><em>Crossing the border</em></p>

<p>First impression of Lithuania was that it was full of forest, the road signs
changed their form, and so did the roads.</p>

<p>I tried to initially avoid the "orange" roads, which seemed to be minor
arteries through the country, instead I threaded my way through country roads
- to begin with these were asphault, but soon gave way to devlish gravel.
The roads were wide enough for two cars side by side, and the surface
varied, sometimes it was just sand and my tires would slide, otherwise there
were ruts, as if a tractor had driven over concrete and it had set with the
tread marks - riding over this was bone-shaking - then there were sections
that were packed earth, and which you could ride reasonably smothely over as
long as you could avoid the large rocks scattered around.</p>

<p>Whilst riding over all of this I became concerned about my laptop, which is
sitting in my front panier, completely unprotected. Twice so far I have turned
it on and it was dead, and required a reboot - which might be related to
excessive vibration, so far it is fine, but I am now making an effort to wrap
it up in my hoodie to dampen the vibrations.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-08/6.JPG" alt="Raw road" /></p>

<p><em>Horrible road</em></p>

<p>I did my first two Lithuanian lessons, initially it bore some resemblance to
Polish, but not so much subsequently, although the sentence structure seems to
be the same or similar. Lithianian and Latvian and sibling languages descended
from Baltic-Slavic, and they are, according to Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_language">the closest living
languages</a> to
proto-Indo-European (which is the common ancestor of most European languages).</p>

<p>So far I have "A-chew" (thanks) and "Ar(rr) youze soren-te-te Engleske" - do you
understand English (untested).</p>

<p>I managed to cover 80k and ride for 5 hours before having lunch. I stopped at
a Lithuanian shop, which resembled very much shops I had visited in Slovenia.
They had lots of buckets of sweets which you could mix and match. I couldn't
find my peanut butter, so just picked up some sweets and some peanuts then
found a bench (after a long passive search) in the next town where I sat down
and put some peanuts in some bread, and washed it down with some chocolate
sweets.</p>

<p>I then continued, it was only 12km north to my preferred destination, I had
quickly researched places to stay on Google, and this place had a campsite, it
also had hotels, but they seemed "expensive" on the google search (i.e. the
cheapest was €30). When I reached the turning to the campsite I checked the
prices again, and realised the last time I had selected "2 Guests", when
selecting "1 Guest" I found the price was actually €15, and decided that fo
r that price I could stay in the hotel.</p>

<p>The hotel was about 1.5k from the center, they charged €20 (I guess I
should have booked) and they don't have breakfast. They do however have a
guest kitchen, and were able to take my clothes to be washed for €2, and I
don't have any worries about the bike, which is stored securely underneath the
stairs.</p>

<p>Lithuania is then cheaper than I thought.</p>

<p>I walked to town for dinner, stopping by a huge supermarket on the way to
checkout what they had, and they had no peanut butter. I then continued the
remaining 1km to the center, at which point it started raining hard and I ran
to the underpass and sheletered as two kids shot past me on their bikes
clearly elated to be getting wet. I couldn't really be too happy about it
though. After the main thrust of the rain stopped, I ventured outside placing
the panier containing my laptop over my head as a makeshift umbrella.</p>

<p>I found a cafe (as it was still to early to have dinner) and ordered a coffee,
and did some laptopping, the cafe also did Pizza, and is evidentally popular
hangout for young people. I got a menu, and was happy to see a dedicated
vegetarian setion in the menu, which is a welcome change from Poland (assuming
this is not exceptional).</p>

<p>On the way back I revisited the supermarket and picked up some mix-and-match
chocolates, some cereal, and two of the many new beers which I have never seen
before, but when checking the clerk said something like "No beers". After
researching it is <a href="https://nordan.org/lithuania-to-raise-legal-drinking-age-shorten-alcohol-selling-hours/">illegal to sell beers after
20:00</a>
in Lithuania - then I was confused because it was only 19:30, further research
led me to the fact that Lithuania is EET (UTC+2), compared to my watch which
is CET (UTC+1). So no beer for me this evening.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-08/7.png" alt="No beers" /></p>

<p><em>No beers after 20:00</em></p>

<p>It is 57k taking major roads to the nearest city, Kaunas, or 120k as the bird
flies to Vilenus - my next major checkpoint, and potentially a place to take a
rest day, but it's unlikely I can do it in a single day on minor roads, so
will investigate further.</p>
